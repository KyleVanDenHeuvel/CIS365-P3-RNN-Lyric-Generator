[Verse 1]
Lights go down, wheels go 'round
I'm taking you home
Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now
I'm not ready to shut it down
The way the dashboard glow
Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind
And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot
Stop this car and throw it in park and just

[Chorus]
Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot
(Slow dance in a parking lot)

[Verse 2]
A half song gone, one door open, across the lot
A rent-a-cop's rolling a security car
Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time
To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks
You start humming the very last verse to "She's Every Woman"
And I don't care what song comes next
I'm falling right here, don't want a safety net in a

[Chorus]
Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot

[Post-Chorus]
And get close to you
Making the most of whatever we got, even if it's just

[Chorus]
A slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot[Verse 1]
You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new

[Pre-Chorus]
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Verse 2]
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'

[Chorus]
And I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Bridge]
Yeah, baby, mmm
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
You standin' there in that dress
Girl, it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
Oh, I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Outro]
Oh, you know it, baby
Mmm[Verse 1]
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that "come get me" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Verse 2]
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV"
And she falls asleep

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Bridge]
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me[Verse 1]
She got that "hey y'all" little southern drawl that she got from her mama
Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter what we're listening to
Spinning her around the living room
And I fall apart every time

[Chorus]
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Yes, she does

[Verse 2]
She's got her feet on the dash
Hair blowing back, hand out the window
Making up half the words that she's singing
And she takes an hour to pick a  movie out
Five minutes in and she's passing out
And I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd stay there forever if I could
Doing nothing never felt so good
And I wish that I could stop time

[Chorus]
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Oh, yes she does
And I don't wanna think about where I would be without her, oh
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes, whoa
Yeah, my dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life

[Outro]
Oh, she does
Back to life[Verse 1]
Water towers are made for hearts and names
Friday nights are made for football games
Fallin' leaves are made for fallin' in
Front porch steps are made for goodnight kissin'
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

[Verse 2]
Summer jobs are made for spendin' cash
Second dates are made for goin' fast
Early curfews are made for sneakin' past
2 a.m. was made for pissed off dads
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

[Chorus]
Like a ship without a sea
Or a song without a melody
I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do
'Cause I was made for you

[Verse 3]
Smoky bars are made for "How 'bout a dance?"
Open roads are made for holdin' hands and
Laid back seats are made for young love
Two pink lines are made for growin' up
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

[Chorus]
Like a ship without a sea
Or a song without a melody
I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do
'Cause I was made for you

[Verse 4]
Tiny shoes are made for tiny feet
My two arms are made for where you sleep
Sky was made for the moon and stars
You were made to steal my heart
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you[Verse 1]
We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down a coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes
Come to think, I miss them all
And damn, babe, it's all your fault

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Verse 2]
Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God, I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my)
Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Bridge]
Don't you remember Times Square?
And people counting down everywhere
2000-whatever, no, I didn't care
'Cause baby you were there
And once again, couldn't help but stare

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah, you guessed it, girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you

[Outro]
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you[Verse 1]
Girl, I’ve always loved you, but something’s changed
Blame it on time, the road or the ride, but it ain’t the same
It’s a different kind of feeling, not the one I knew
From the sweet on your lips, to how your hand in mine fits
Girl I’ve always loved you but

[Chorus]
I don’t love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It’s stronger the longer I’m with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn’t know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby I do, I don’t love you like I used to, no

[Verse 2]
What we got ain’t got no ending, like a band of solid gold
It’s sweeter with time like strawberry wine, it gets as good as it gets old
And oh, we thought we knew what it meant back then
But I keep fallin' all in higher than I’ve ever been, oh no, oh

[Chorus]
I don’t love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It’s stronger the longer I’m with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn’t know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby I do, I don’t love you like I used to, no

[Break]
Oh no
Oh no, no-no

[Chorus]
I don’t love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It’s stronger the longer I’m with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn’t know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby I do, I don’t love you like I used to, no

[Outro]
Oh, oh
I don’t love you like I used to
Oh, oh, no
Love you like I used to
Love you like I used to, yeah
Oh, I don’t love you like I used to[Verse 1: Jordan, Jordan & Chad]
Sometimes I think this world's too much
All the hurt, all the hate, all it takes is a human touch
It's so easy to get lost in the light
Make a change, make a choice, all the noise, we can drown it out

[Chorus: Jordan, Chad & Simon, Chad]
Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two

[Verse 2: Simon, Simon & Chad]
Kiss me like there's no one else for miles
Take it fast, take it slow, letting go for a little while
Heaven's so close to the both of us
For the rest of the night we can fly, we can rise above

[Chorus: Jordan, Chad & Simon, Chad, (Jordan)]
Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two (Oh)

[Bridge: Jordan, Simon, Chad & (All)]
Girl, for you (I'd build a world)
For two (I'd build a world)
Girl, for you (I'd build a world)
For two, yeah

[Chorus: Jordan, Chad & Simon, Chad]
Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two[Verse 1]
We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long til I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Outro]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Still chasing you, still chasing you[Verse 1]
How can someone stand so damn close
And feel like they're worlds away?
I can see your sad story eyes
So how do you have no words to say?
All I want is to fall in deeper
Than I've ever been
Why won't you let me?
I can handle your heart, so help me

[Chorus]
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashin' in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you

[Verse 2]
Like a lighthouse I've been shinin' bright
Through the dark for the both of us
And "I've done it outta love" is not enough
But God, how I wish it was
And I don't wanna find out
How much lonely I can take before you lose me
Baby, look at me and swear you won't lose me

[Chorus]
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashin' in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you

[Bridge]
I can't let it go
From moments in your arms
But they come back again
The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves
The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves

[Chorus]
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashin' in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you[Intro]
Mhm, mhm, mhm
Mhm, mhm, mhm

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of sleeping on us
I'm over dodging this crush
I'm sick of waiting 10 minutes just text you back
So you don't get to thinking that I'm too attached
I'm more than benefit friends
I'm more than just a weekend binge
I want you to be my hottie riding shotty
I don't want nobody's body but your body, babe
All I'm trying to say is

[Chorus 1]
There's a difference between “Miss you” and “I miss your face”
There's a difference in “What's going on?” and “Baby how was your day?”
Yeah, there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two
There's a difference in “Love ya” and “I love you”
And I wanna be the difference
Yeah I do

[Verse 2]
I wanna be the difference between “Hey what's up?” and “What we gonna do tonight?”
Between yeah she's cool we hang out sometimes and that girl right there she's mine
Between leading you on and holding your hand
Sitting it out and girl let's dance
Between playing it safe and taking a chance
Yeah pumping the brakes or hitting the gas

[Chorus 2]
There's a difference between “Miss you” and “I miss your face”
There's a difference in “What's going on?” and “Baby how was your day?”
Yeah, there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two
There's a difference in “Love ya” and “I love you”
And I wanna be the difference

[Bridge]
Close the distance
And be that puzzle piece you didn't even know you was missing babe
Oh I wanna be the difference
Yeah I do

[Chorus 3]
There's a difference between “Miss you” and “I miss your face”
There's a difference in  “What's going on?” and “Baby how was your day?”
Yeah there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two
There's a difference in “Love ya” and “I love you”
And I wanna be the difference I am
Well I wanna be the difference
I wanna be the difference[Verse 1]
I don't know who we'll be in a couple years
But  I don't wanna think a second past this minute
Cuz'  you're here, in it
I don't know how you could make me so confused
And so sure at the same time
Half  a sentence and I guess the rest
How  are you in my head
How is this night so perfect
I  don't know how this ends
I'm just bein' honest

[Chorus]
I will always be in love with who you are
Right here, right now, with me tonight (ohhh)
And  I will always see you like this, reckless, fearless
You're tellin' me for the first time
I'm always gonna love you
Hey-ya, Hey-ey-ey-ya

[Verse 2]
I look at you and laugh, cuz you're cover's blown
And we both know what this change is
No going back, we both know that
This is our time and I'm hiding at how scared I am that
You won't always be mine but whatever happens

[Chorus]
I will always be in love with who you are
Right here, right now, with me tonight (ohhh)
And I will always see you like this, reckless, fearless
You're tellin' me for the first time
I'm always gonna love you (I'm always gonna love you)
Hey-ya, Hey-ey-ey-ya

I will always be in love with who you are tonight (ohhh)
I will always be in love with who you are
Right here, right now, with me tonight (ohhh)
And I will always see you like this, reckless, fearless
You're tellin' me for the first time
I'm always gonna love you
Hey-ya, Hey-ey-ey-ya[Verse 1]
Lights are down, but you're shining like you always do
Every day, I'm reminded of the miracle of you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're too good for coincidence
And too perfect for an accident
And I'm not sure where Heaven is
But every night, I get a glimpse

[Chorus]
And I know I'm blessed
Watching you spin in that dress
Making my heart beat out my chest
I can't count the times I've heard
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm blessed
And all I ain't got is my breath
You stole it the first time we meet
You're more than I deserve
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm

[Verse 2]
I keep checking you for halos
Swear you're an angel in disguise
You poke my mind from every angle, and I
I can see Heaven in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You're too good for coincidence
And too perfect for an accident
And I'm not sure where Heaven is
But every night, I get a glimpse

[Chorus]
And I know I'm blessed (Blessed)
Watching you spin in that dress (Dress)
Making my heart beat out my chest
I can't count the times I've heard
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed)
And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath)
You stole it the first time we met
You're more than I deserve
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm

[Bridge]
Baby, you're the kind of girl that I've always prayed for
And I swear by my dying breath that I will be faithful
Oh, baby
'Cause I'm on my knees (I'm on my knees)
Whoa, you make me believe

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm blessed (Blessed)
Watching you spin in that dress (Dress)
Making my heart beat out my chest
I can't count the times I've heard
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed)
And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath)
You stole it the first time we met
You're more than I deserve
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm blessed3/1

Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, love suicide is killing me
You're getting into my head, you're like a guillotine
You've got my gasping for air in your vicinity
And now your saying some things that you don't really mean
That's really mean, how the hell I'm caught up in between?
Devil's advocate trying not to intervene
Putting up a front like it ain't a thing to me
I swear this gotta be the worst position to be in, be in
I guess you feel like you've been ignored
And your perfect picture turn into a jigsaw
'Cause when your round me you get a little withdrawn
And we just can't seem to find time to sit and talk
I know she isn't sure, uh

[Refrain: Tinie Tempah]
What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house
And everything becomes so cold?
Baby, that's the only thing I wanna know

[Chorus 1: Ester Dean (Tinie Tempah)]
Tell me the reason why
You committed love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose
I'm all out of tears
Time to get outta here
You made it very clear
You did it on purpose (Uh)

[Hook (Condensed): Ester Dean (Tinie Tempah)]
Our love suicide
Our love suicide (Love suicide)
Our love suicide (Uh)

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
I feel like I'm about to break down
Why you acting like a kid up in a playground? (Huh?)
If you got something on your mind why don't you lay it out?
Feels like the end of us is coming any day now
Any day, I thought we'd never separate
I could be destroyed but not defeated: Ernest Hemingway
You know its probably for the best anyway
'Cause my suspicions now is worrying your jealous face
Let's go our separate ways, uh

[Refrain: Tinie Tempah]
What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house
And everything becomes so cold?
Baby, that's the only thing I wanna know

[Chorus 1: Ester Dean (Tinie Tempah)]
Tell me the reason why
You committed love suicide (Suicide)
I think you want our love to die (Uh)
You did it on purpose
I'm all out of tears (I'm all out of tears)
Time to get outta here
You made it very clear (Uh)
You did it on purpose

[Hook: Ester Dean (Tinie Tempah)]
Our love suicide
Our love suicide (Love suicide)
Our love suicide (Uh)
Why would you hurt us?
Our love suicide
Our love suicide (Love suicide)
Our love suicide (Uh, yeah)

[Bridge: Ester Dean]
Does it make you happy to see me down?
Does it make your day to see me drown?
I guess I'm your entertainment
You don't know what you wasted
But soon you will see
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Tinie Tempah]
What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Within four walls and one house
And everything becomes so cold?
Baby, that's the only thing I wanna know

[Chorus 2: Ester Dean (Tinie Tempah)]
Tell me the reason why (Why)
You committed love suicide (Uh)
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose (No)
I'm all out of tears (I'm all out of tears)
Time to get outta here
You made it very clear (Uh)
You did it on purpose, purpose (Suicide, love suicide)
You did it on purpose, purpose (Suicide, love suicide)
Made me feel worthless, worthless (Suicide, love suicide)
Why would you hurt us, hurt us?
You did it on purpose, purpose (Suicide, love suicide)
You did it on purpose, purpose (Suicide, love suicide)
You made me feel worthless, worthless (Suicide, love suicide)
Why would you hurt us, hurt us?

[Outro: Tinie Tempah]
What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house
And everything becomes so cold?[Verse 1]
I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I know that you've been wondering
Mmm, so here goes nothing

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Verse 2]
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
One of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm, it's time you hear em

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Bridge]
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout ya
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah, you had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
In case you didn't know[Verse 1]
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going nowhere with no one but me
I was one in a hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me

[Chorus 1]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Verse 2]
I was a worn out set of shoes
Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

[Chorus 2]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Bridge]
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea

[Chorus 2]
I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Outro]
Thank God I'm yours
Thank God I'm yours, yours
Thank God I'm yours[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
He's as cool as California
Homegrown like they do it in Georgia
With a heart as big as the Lone Star State
Hard to catch like a Kansas breeze
Strong like a Tennessee hickory
He's smooth like the bourbon Kentucky makes

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Hot like the Phoenix sun, y'all
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm fallin' like a Denver snowfall

[Chorus]
Whole world in my living room
It's all you, babe
If I could paint paradise, it'd be you
It's all you, babe
Every red pin on the map I'm holding
You're everywhere I've been
And everywhere I'm goin'
From Backwoods to the neon glowin'
You're everywhere I've been
And everywhere I'm goin'

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
He's my one-way outta town
Even sitting shotgun riding around
Feels like an East Coast, coastline drive
He's a take-my-breath like a Paris sunset
Takes my heart where it hasn't been yet

[Chorus]
Whole world in my living room
It's all you, babe
If I could paint paradise, it'd be you
It's all you, babe
Every red pin on the map I'm holding
You're everywhere I've been
And everywhere I'm goin'
From Backwoods to the neon glowin'
You're everywhere I've been
And everywhere I'm goin'

[Post-Chorus]
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere I'm goin'

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Hot like the Phoenix sun y'all
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm fallin' like a Denver snowfall

[Chorus]
Whole world in my living room
It's all you, babe
If I could paint paradise, it'd be you
It's all you, babe
Every red pin on the map I'm holding
You're everywhere I've been
And everywhere I'm goin'
From Backwoods to the neon glowin'
You're everywhere I've been
And everywhere I'm goin'

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Everywhere I'm goin', goin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Everywhere I've been and everywhere I'm goin'

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh[Verse 1]
This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic, don't it?
I'm right where I wanna be

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this

[Verse 2]
I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never
Had to even leave this room

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
Could be better than this

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this (heaven)
Could be better than this (heaven, heaven)

[Outro]
I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time[Verse 1]
I've never seen Venice
Or slow danced under Paris lights
Never stood by the pyramids
Or hiked up the great divide
I've never been to Times Square
To celebrate the New Year
And I've never seen Willie Nelson live
And if I never get to
That's alright

[Chorus]
'Cause I've seen you with your hair down in your bare feet
Dancin' 'round the living room spillin' wine on your dress
And I've seen you on a bench seat
In a tank top and your blue jeans
Gettin' your lipstick on my neck
So if all I do is live in this small town with you
And never leave
I've seen all I need to see

[Verse 2]
I've never seen Ireland
And those green hills that roll for miles
But my guess is that they ain't got nothin' on your green eyes
And I've never seen Niagara falls or stood inside the prison walls
Where Cash recorded live
Some may say I'm missin' out
But that's a lie

[Chorus]
'Cause I've seen you when your song's on
And you're singin' words that are all wrong
And you swear to me that that's how it goes
And I've seen you when tears fall
'Cause the episode that you just saw
Felt like more than just a show
So if all I do is live in this small town with you
And never leave
I've seen all I need to see

[Outro]
Yeah, I've seen you with your hair down in your bare feet
Dancin' 'round the living room spillin' wine on your dress
And I've seen you on a bench seat
In a tank top and your blue jeans
Gettin' your lipstick on my neck
So if all I do is live in this small town with you
And never leave
Yeah, that'd be fine with me
'Cause I've seen all I need to see[Verse 1]
"You know when you know," you hear that all your life
Well whoever they are, turns out they were right
Sunshine, the good times, yeah, we got a few behind us
But when the bad times come, I ain't gonna run

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
I'll be wrapped around your finger
Girl, you got me 'til we run out of time
Rich or poor, rain or shine
The wind's gonna blow wherever it goes
And the road is gonna wind
Doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
Forevermore, I'll be yours and you'll be mine

[Verse 2]
When I look at you now, I see all I ever wanted
You make me wanna hang around
And hold your hand, we're a hundred
You make love feel so real, so simple and honest
It's in every breath and every kiss
Yeah, the thing about you is

[Chorus]
Doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
I'll be wrapped around your finger
Girl, you got me 'til we run out of time
Rich or poor, rain or shine
The wind's gonna blow wherever it goes
And the road is gonna wind
Doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
Forevermore, I'll be yours and you'll be mine

[Bridge]
You'll be mine, baby
It don't matter where or whatever happens
Girl, I'll still be there

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
I'll be wrapped around your finger
Girl, you got me 'til we run out of time
Rich or poor, rain or shine
The wind's gonna blow wherever it goes
And the road is gonna wind
It doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine (Diamonds or twine)
It doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
Forevermore, I'll be yours and you'll be mine

[Outro]
Diamonds or twine[Intro]
This is the end of Side One of this record
Please now turn it over for the second side

[Verse 1]
I got a phone that won't die
You're up in the air, landing tonight
So I'll leave a message for ya, get it when you touch down
If I'm being honest, I'm a little drunk now
I got a bed that's too big without ya
I got a heart that don't beat without ya
Get so jealous when you ain't by my side
I know it's selfish, but I need you tonight

[Chorus]
So text when you touch down, straight to my place now
These nights without you, they're so hard to sleep
Come put your things down, I'll order take out
No more to say now, baby, just make out with me
Baby, just make out with me

[Verse 2]
You got a kiss I still taste
And I feel your lips from miles away
I got one more minute of this message to burn
I hope you get it 'cause I mean every word

[Chorus]
So text when you touch down, straight to my place now
These nights without you, they're so hard to sleep
Come put your things down, I'll order take out
No more to say now, baby, just make out with me
Baby, just make out with me
Just like it used to be, baby, just make out with me[Verse 1]
You said "I love you" to me
And I don't know what that means
So I froze on my feet
People use it so carelessly
And I couldn’t believe
That you would dive in so deep
And you said perfectly
Everything I’ve been feelin' about you
It’s time to break the chains that held me back from you

[Chorus]
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

[Verse 2]
Well I was never the type
To put it all on the line
But I've been changing my mind since you opened my eyes
It was the way that the light
Picked you out of that night
Then you were right by my side
Put a soul in my body
And now it’s time to close the space between the two of us

[Chorus]
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

[Bridge]
Oh, baby it's time
Oh, it's time

[Chorus]
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now

[Outro]
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line[Verse 1]
Like a rainy Sunday mornin'
Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs

[Bridge]
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Verse 2]
You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah, I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Bridge]
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
You make it easySometimes no matter how hard you try
This life's gonna be unfair sometimes
I see you looking at me like you wanna know why
Baby, you got me, you got me
I don't know why the wind that blows
Ain't ever at our back
Or that the road that we're rollin on ain't ever flat
It turns and it twists
Don't know what the answer is, but

You, you got me
When the pieces don't fall together
When you wish your best was better, baby
You, you got me
Right here by your side hanging on for the ride
When your dreams don't dream and the songs don't sing
And the grass ain't green and the ends don't meet
And the prayers you're sending up don't seem to reach
You got me

Those days when your faith ain't pulling you through
I'll be right there believing enough for two
When you don't give a damn cause you think that you can't
Get the mountain to move I'll be saying we can
I'll be taking your hand, and I'll never let go
Baby you gotta know

That you, you got me
When the pieces don't fall together
When you wish your best was better, baby
You, you got me
Right here by your side hanging on for the ride
When your dreams don't dream and the songs don't sing
And the grass ain't green and the ends don't meet
And the prayers you're sending up don't seem to reach
You got me

Sometimes no matter how hard you try
This life's gonna be unfair sometimes

But you, you got me
When the pieces don't fall together
When you wish your best was better, baby
You, you got me
Right here by your side hanging on for the ride
When your dreams don't dream and the songs don't sing
And the grass ain't green and the ends don't meet
And the prayers you're sending up don't seem to reach
You got me
You got me[Verse 1]
I know it's not likely to falling so easily
But  I'm falling soon as you walk in the room
I  know that you don't mean to make it like this for me
But I'm breaking breaking all my walls for you
Now you looking at me looking back at you
I'm  trying to figure out what I'm gonna do

[Chorus]
I  don't know how, how to slow down with you
But baby I don't know now if I even want to
You  got my heartbeat beating at a speed of light
I'm so caught up couldn't tell you why
But baby I don't know how, how to slow down with you
Yeah, I don't know how

[Verse 2]
I'm  fine wasting time in your headlights all night tonight
If it was anybody else I would've gone home by now
I don't know what it is but this is different
Even when you're here I kinda miss you, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't know how, how to slow down with you
But baby I don't know now if I even want to
Yeah, you got my heartbeat beating at a speed of light
I'm so caught up couldn't tell you why
But baby I don't know how, how to slow down with you

Yeah, I don't know how
Baby I don't know how, how to slow down
Baby I don't know how, how to slow down
Oh yeah

I don't know how, how to slow down with you, yeah
But baby I don't know now if I even want to
Yeah, you got my heartbeat beating at a speed of light
I'm so caught up couldn't tell you why
But baby I don't know how, how to slow down with you

Yeah, I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how to slow down[Verse 1]
This is the gospel, according to me
A tale of whiskey turned to wine
Ain't no movin’ of a mountain, ain't no parting of the sea
But I stand here a witness of something just as divine

[Chorus]
My miracle is five foot five
No doubt in my mind, she's the reason I’m alive
I wasn't always spiritual, oh, but one thing's for sure
How could I not have faith in the God that created her?

[Verse 2]
My mama used to pray someday I'd see the light
I never thought it'd be in someone's eyes
In a crowded restaurant on a Friday night
I heard angels sing, my whole life changed, and I realized

[Chorus]
My miracle was standin' right there
Lookin' so beautiful with blue jeans and long brown hair
I wasn’t always spiritual, oh, but one thing’s for sure
How could I not have faith in the God that created her?

[Bridge]
You see me now, it's crazy how
My life changed
But here I stand, a better man
And you can blame my miracle

[Outro]
I wasn’t always spiritual, oh, but one thing's for sure
How could I not have faith
Yeah, how could anybody not have faith
In the God that created her?[Verse 1]
I hate Shakespeare and Gosling and cakes with white frosting
Two names in a heart-shaped tattoo
I think cupid is stupid and violets are purple not blue
I hate catching bouquets, the honeymoon phase
And letterman jackets don't fit
Your eyes can't hold stars and you'd die if your heart really skipped

[Chorus]
I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you

[Verse 2]
I hate pink hearts with glitter and Valentine's dinner
And roses just die in a week
We were drunk when we met so we don't know our anniversary (Whoops)
Oh, and I'm far too vain to kiss in the rain
The clouds, they aren't numbered to nine
And you make me feel something
But it sure as hell ain't butterflies

[Chorus]
I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
Yeah

[Interlude]
I really do

[Bridge]
And I'll always love you but I don't have to sing it
"For worse or for better" don't rhyme
They say I got the right one so now I should write one
But I'd rather just show you tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
I hate love songs
The old and the new
I hate love songs
But I love you[Verse 1]
Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm

[Verse 2]
Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah
Mmm

[Bridge]
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace

[Chorus 2]
Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man
Mmm[Verse 1]
I got a fast car, gassed up, sittin' in the driveway
Got a road that I know like the back of my hand
We could head out right now, baby, we could fly away
And disappear outta here fast as we can

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I miss you, baby
Ooh, I'm going crazy

[Chorus]
There's a diamond sky that's waitin' for us just outside of town
With the moon hangin' for me and you, baby
We can cut the headlights out when there ain't no one else around
Kill the space in between, slide across that leather seat
Heart to heart, face to face, you know all I wanna do
Is get closer, closer, closer to you
Closer to you

[Verse 2]
Wanna taste that great wide open freedom
Wanna make the distance razor thin
Wanna feel you feel me feel you breathing
'Til we can't tell where you end and where I begin

[Chorus]
There's a diamond sky that's waiting for us just outside of town
With the moon hangin' for me and you, baby
We can cut the headlights out when there ain't no one else around
Kill the space in between, slide across that leather seat
Heart to heart, face to face, you know all I wanna do
Is get closer, closer, closer to you
Closer to you, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I miss you, baby
Ooh, I'm going crazy

[Chorus]
There's a diamond sky that's waiting for us just outside of town
With the moon hangin' for me and you, baby
We can cut the headlights out when there ain't no one else around
Kill the space in between, slide across that leather seat
Heart to heart, face to face, you know all I wanna do
Is get closer, closer, closer to you
Closer to you
Closer, closer, closer to you
Closer to you[Verse 1]
Did I stop and watch the sunset fade?
What gave me life and took my breath away?
Did I take a last-call stranger home
So I wouldn't have to wake up alone?

[Chorus]
I heard I was a wild one
Actin like a child, son
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me

[Verse 2]
Was I just another ghost in this town?
Who was I when no one was around?
Did I even know that I was livin' without?
Who are my favorite songs about?

[Chorus]
I heard I was a wild one
Actin like a child, son
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me

[Bridge]
Was my heart beatin' in my chest?
And was I even alive before the day we met?

[Chorus]
I heard I was a wild one
Actin' like a child, son
Heard I was a fast one
Always was last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me
No, I don't remember me before you[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]
Sitting with you in a dark room
Warmed by a fireplace
You know there's just something about you
You brighten my day
I got something to run past you
I just hope I say it right
So I take your hand and ask you
Have you made plans for the rest of your life?

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worryin' about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives

[Verse 2: Faith Hill]
I've been making plans for children
Since I've been looking in your eyes
I even have names picked out for them
Daughter'd be Rose
Son, it'd be Ryan

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worrying about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives

[Bridge: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
I don't really care about those storm clouds brewing
Oh, as long as you're here by my side
Oh, we'll be young, oh we'll be young
Oh, we'll be young, when we're old

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
Oh, I'll be fine
If my gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even when time takes its toll
I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you, I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you
We'll stay young for the rest of our life[Verse 1]
They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 2]
So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

[Chorus 2]
When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 3]
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen

[Outro]
We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me[Verse 1]
I feel like 16, sneakin' out in Daddy's car tonight
Index finger tracin' all the stars in your eyes
It was music playin' in the background
But I don't even care what they're singin' about
I'm just 16, sneakin' out in Daddy's car tonight

[Chorus]
I'ma need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
Timeout right now 'cause I'm fallin' too fast for you
Listenin' to your life story on the hood of a '64 Cadillac
One, I'ma lean in to kiss you
Two, say a little too much too soon
Three, try not to forget to breathe
I need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
1-2-3, Mississippi

[Verse 2]
Like a roller coaster car comin' off the tracks
Watchin' all my self control fall through your hands
I know I could try to fight this
But right now it looks like this
Rollercoaster car is comin' off the tracks, yeah

[Chorus]
I'ma need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
Timeout right now 'cause I'm fallin' too fast for you
Listenin' to your life story on the hood of a '64 Cadillac
One, I'ma lean in to kiss you
Two, say a little too much too soon
Three, try not to forget to breathe
I need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
1-2-3, Mississippi, yeah

[Bridge]
Count down to the point of no return
But count fast, baby I'm already yours

[Chorus]
I'ma need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
Timeout right now 'cause I'm fallin' too fast for you
Listenin' to your life story on the hood of a '64 Cadillac
One, I'ma lean in to kiss you
Two, say a little too much too soon
Three, try not to forget to breathe
I need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
1-2-3, Mississippi, mmm
Oh, Mississippi
1-2, 1-2-3, Mississippi
Whoa, whoa, Mississippi[Verse 1]
Girl, I would dial your number without lookin'
And  you’d always pick it up as soon as it rang
And  I'd hear you say, "I hear my Mama coming"
And you'd hide the phone up underneath the sheets

[Chorus]
And I’d hear her say, "Girl, haven't I told you?
Yeah,  I know who you're talking to
It's  that bad boy
It's that wrong-side-of-the-tracks boy
That  break-your-heart-and-won't-come-back boy
Why's that boy the one you love?"
You're not that bad boy

[Verse 2]
You weren’t scared but you had every reason
Me  and my boys were nothin’ short of dangerous
But you said, "Boy, you know I've heard you talk to Jesus
How’s a tough guy like you afraid to love?"

[Chorus]
You ain't so bad boy
You've done some things you can't take back, boy
But I see straight through that boy
And that boy is the one I love

[Bridge]
You ain’t so bad boy
No, you ain't so bad
You ain't so bad

[Verse 3]
Well, I remember sitting down beside your Mama
My hands shaking in my pocket with that ring
She said, "Boy, I always knew you loved my daughter
She loves you too and I think I know what she sees"
So alright, bad boy
Long as them old habits don't come back, boy
You know that's how she lost her dad, boy
And that boy is the one I loved
He was my bad boy
He was my bad boy

[Outro]
Guess you ain't so bad
No, you ain't so bad

[Verse 1]
Watchin' you watch me take down my hair
Slow motion falling, feeling your stare
I wish your hands were where your eyes are at
Tracing my shoulders all the way down my back
You're like a different language I want to speak
Like a handsome stranger I want to meet
You make me want to know all the unknown
Paintin' up trouble like gold

[Chorus]
You get away
With making me want
To forever stay here in your space everyday
You get away with it
You get away
With making me fawn, making me trip
'Gain and again, everyday
You get away with it

[Verse 2]
Keep the red pourin' 'cause I know we're done
I'm all here for it, this buzz has just begun
You slid right under that yellow caution tape
And I never questioned a thing

[Chorus]
You get away
With making me want
To forever stay here in your space everyday
You get away with it
You get away
With making me fawn, making me trip
'Gain and again, everyday
You get away with it

[Bridge]
You're makin' me trip
Makin' me want to stay forever
Everyday baby
Again and again, and again, and again, and again, everyday
Again and again, and again, and again, and again, everyday
Don't just leave, now

[Chorus]
You get away (You get away)
With making me want
To forever stay here in your space everyday
You get away with it
You get away
With making me fawn, making me trip
'Gain and again, everyday (Every single damn day)
You get away with it
You get away
With making me want
To forever stay here in your space everyday
(Here in your space, baby)
You get away with it
You get away
With making me fawn, making me trip
'Gain and again, everyday
You get away
With it[Verse 1]
All that I know
Is you caught me at the right time
Keep me in your glow
'Cause I'm having such a good time
With you

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
I used to get sad
And lonely when the sun went down
But it's different now
'Cause I love the light that I've found
In you

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

[Bridge]
You make the world look beautiful, ooh
I thought I'd seen it all before
But looking through your eyes
It looks like paradise

[Chorus]
You've set my world on fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
You're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Yeah, I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Golden hour[Verse 1: Trisha Yearwood]
You were the light that wounds the eye
The pain that time could not deny
I felt resistance fading fast
As if you saved the heart for last
I knew right then, no matter what
That this would take all that I've got
There's really nothing I could do
Oh, this much in love with you

[Chorus: Trisha Yearwood & Don Henley]
So break my faith, forget my name
Either way, it's all the same
You're my first word, my last breath
My will to live when nothing's left
Tear this heart right out of me
Lock it up, then lose the key
Curse my name when you kneel to pray
I'm gonna love you anyway

[Verse 2]
I toss and turn helplessly
There's nothin' no one can do for me
You're the first thought in my soul
There's no regaining my control
And should one day I stand accused
By other loves I have refused
When hope is gone and I am weak
You are the last name I will speak

[Chorus: Trisha Yearwood & Don Henley]
So break my faith, forget my name
Either way, it's all the same
You're my first word, my last breath
My will to live when nothing's left
Tear this heart right out of me
Lock it up, then lose the key
Curse my name when you kneel to pray
I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love you anyway[Verse 1]
I'd promise you forever if I could
If I could slow down the hands of time I would
I know they say all good things must end
If I could do it all over I would do it all over
Over and over again

[Chorus]
We'll go on 'til were pushin' up daisies
We'll grow old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby
We'll never get enough, we'll be livin' it up right down to the day we die
Naw, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive

[Verse 2]
'Til I held you close I never felt the feelin'
And now I'll feel that way 'til the last sunset goes down
You turned a stubborn southern boy into a believer
Believe me when I say, "It's gonna stay that way 'til they lay me in the ground"

[Chorus]
We'll go on 'til we're pushing up daisies
We'll grow old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby
We'll never get enough, we'll be livin' it up right down to the day we die
Naw, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive

[Chorus]
We'll go on 'til were pushing up daisies
We'll be old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby
We'll never get enough, we'll be livin' it up right down to the day we die
Naw, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive

[Outro]
When our last breath is gone
And they carve our name in stone
Oh, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive[Verse 1]
You were talkin' trash, we were tossin' bags
When I caught your name at a corn hole game
September Saturday in Rocky Top
On top of G10 parking lot
Said "Girl, where you sittin'? I got an extra ticket
It's right on the 50"

[Chorus]
You had a 16 home team jersey on
Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watchin' you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You would've thought that post-game kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime

[Verse 2]
They sent out the Pride of the Southland band
And all I could think about was holdin' your hand
Was just gonna catch it on a couch TV
And last second scored a couple tickets for free
But baby I'd have paid anything to see

[Chorus]
You had a 16 home team jersey on
Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watchin' you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You would've thought that post-game kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime

[Bridge]
Now every time the leaves start fallin' down
I get to thinkin' 'bout

[Chorus]
That 16 home team jersey on
Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watchin' you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You would've thought that post-game kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime
You had me by halftime
You had me by halftime[Verse 1]
It all starts when it's me and you, going out on Friday night
Feels like the radio when your tires roll into my drive
Then my heart stops, like a beat drop
It's a symphony when you sweet talk
Make this quiet town, feel electric, loud
When the lights going down
Every word out of your mouth

[Chorus]
Is like music
Like a 70's soundtrack
When you look at me like that
I lose it
My name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss
When I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out
We're not saying nothing
But it's feeling something like music

[Verse 2]
Before I knew your love
Even with the volume up, it was silent then
And now you're walking in the room all kind of smooth,  like a violin
Everybody else is white noise
So talk to me, cause your voice

[Chorus]
Is like music
Like a 70's soundtrack
When you look at me like that
I lose it
My name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss
When I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out
We're not saying nothing
But it's feeling something like music

I-I-I

[Bridge]
Your song on my skin is like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
So play it again just like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Your song on my skin is like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
So play it again
My whole heart's listening to your music

[Chorus]
Like a 70's soundtrack
When you look at me like that
I lose it
My name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss
When I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out
We're not saying nothing
But it's feeling something like music[Verse 1]
I’ll never settle down
That’s what I always thought
Yeah, I was that kind of man
Just ask anyone

[Chorus]
I don’t dance, But here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It Ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand
Cause, I don’t dance

[Verse 2]
Love’s never come my way
I’ve never been this far
Cause you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart

[Chorus]
No, I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don’t dance
Ohhh
I don’t dance

Ooh

I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere

I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yeah, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don’t dance

Oh
No..

Oooh…[Verse 1]
I took your coat
I wasn't that cold
Gotta a little too close
Come on, don't ya know?
Am I giving you enough to let you know that I want ya?
My heart's beating out loud like thunder
Are you gonna kiss me?
Are you gonna make me wonder?

[Chorus]
It's your move, boy
I'll follow you, boy
I ain't gonna lead, I'm a lady like that
So I'm gonna keep looking at you like I-I-I dare you
I-I-I'm gonna keep looking at ya like I-I-I dare ya

[Verse 2]
These strung up lights are staring right at us
It'd be the perfect time to mess my lipstick up
Tryna keep my cool, but you give me fire
I'm already high, but you could take me higher
Turn this sweet night into something wilder

[Chorus]
It's your move, boy
I'll follow you, boy
I ain't gonna lead, I'm a lady like that
So I'm gonna keep looking at you like I-I-I dare you
I-I-I'm gonna keep looking at ya like I-I-I dare ya

[Bridge]
Am I giving you enough to let you know that I want ya?
My heart's beating out loud like thunder
Are you gonna kiss me?
Are you gonna make me wonder?

[Chorus]
Oh, it's your move, boy
I'll follow you, boy
I ain't gonna lead, I'm a lady like that
So I'm gonna keep looking at you like I-I-I dare you
I-I-I'm gonna keep looking at ya like I-I-I dare ya
It's your move boy
I'll follow you boy
I ain't gonna lead, I'm a lady like that
So I'm gonna keep looking at you like I-I-I dare you
I-I-I'm gonna keep looking at ya like I-I-I dare ya
So I'm gonna keep looking at you like I-I-I dare you[Verse 1]
Girl, it's high time I tell ya
No more messin' around
Time to lay these cards on the table
And just throw it on out
I'm talkin' you and me with the same street name
Same last name, same everything
It's a real thing, a how I feel thing
So I'm a go on and take a swing

[Chorus]
You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeah

[Verse 2]
You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch
If you put a little tea in my glass
Watch a sunset from a gravel road
Kiss me in the kitchen on your tippy toes
Still lovin' on you when the rooster crows
Watchin' way more than the garden grow

[Chorus]
You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs

[Bridge]
Yeah, layin' next to you every night
Sounds like a damn good life

[Chorus]
You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs

[Outro]
Yeah, I'll name the dogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs
Yeah, I'll name the dogsI miss you, I need you
I want you to touch me
We don't have to speak
Let our bodies do the talking

Never get enough, never get enough
So bring me all your love
Hurry it up
Whatever you want
Got my permission

Tonight we can do anything
We can be everything we want to be
And I, I want to feel your lips
And give you all that you've been missing
Champagne rush straight to my head
Got me love drunk, laying in my bed
You don't even need to try
You just set my body on fire
You just set my body on fire

I'm reckless
Only you make me do this
No we can't stop it
And I don't want to stop baby

Never get enough, never get enough
So bring me all your love
Hurry it up
I want to give you, give you my attention

Tonight we can do anything
We can be everything we want to be
And I, I want to feel your lips
And give you all that you've been missing
Champagne rush straight to my head
Got me love drunk, laying in my bed
You don't even need to try
You just set my body on fire
You just set my body on fire

Never get enough, never get enough
So bring me all your love
Hurry it up
I want to give you, give you my attention

Tonight we can do anything
We can be everything we want to be
And I, I want to feel your lips
And give you all that you've been missing
Champagne rush straight to my head
Got me love drunk, laying in my bed
You don't even need to try
You just set my body on fire
You just set my body on fire[Verse 1]
We could go down to the lake
Throw off our shoes
Jump into the water like there's nothing to lose
Sky don't get no bluer, love don't get no truer than this
Then you could wrap me in a blanket
And steal a kiss
Then we could go into town
To that little coffee shop
Go sit under the stars, up on the rooftop
Spend an hour talking, watch the people walking by
When the coffee gets colder you can just hold me tight

[Verse 2]
Something special, something we don't do all the time
Something special, because I am yours and you are mine

[Verse 3]
A little celebration, just because we can
Walking by your side with my hand in your hand
Make a little history, make the kind of memories that last
Stop and smell the roses
You know they go so fast

[Verse 4]
Something special, something we don't do all the time
Something special, because I am yours and we can
Go down to the lake throw off our shoes
Jump into the water like there’s nothing to lose[Verse 1]
If I ever left this town
I'd never settle down
I'd just be wandering around
If I ever left this town
If I wasn't by your side
I'd never be satisfied
Nothing would feel just right
If I wasn't by your side

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm not easy to understand
But you know me like the back of your hand
I'm your girl and you're my man
And we're makin' plans
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
We can go on and on
Won't ever feel too long
I'll always call you home
And we'll go on and on

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I know you like the back of my hand
Got a heart of gold and a piece of land
I'm your girl and you're my man
And we're makin' plans
Mmm, mmm[Verse 1]
I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd, oh
But I can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh whoa, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
What are we waiting on?

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

[Bridge]
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, with the
River rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
We're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh
