[Verse 1]
Way back on the radio dial
The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul
From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll

[Chorus]
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"

[Verse 2]
Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there, but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night

[Chorus]
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"

[Verse 3]
Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better
You gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure

[Chorus]
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"

[Outro]
Keep on dreamin'
Don't let it break your heart[Verse 1]
There's a new wind blowing like I've never known
I'm breathing deeper than I've ever done
And it sure feels good, to finally feel the way I do
I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you
And I am letting go of all my lonely yesterdays
I've forgiven myself for the mistakes I've made
Now there's just one thing, the only thing I wanna do
I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you

[Hook]
Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine
Shining down on me and you
When you put your arms around me
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do

[Verse 2]
I used to run in circles going nowhere fast
I'd take, uh, one step forward and two steps back
Couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to
I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you
Whoa! here we go now!
Hey, I wanna love ya baby

[Hook]
Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine
Shining down on me and you
When you put your arms around me
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do

[Verse 3]
Sometimes it's hard for me to understand
But you're teaching me to be a better man
I don't wanna take this life for granted like I used to do, no, no
I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you
I'm ready to love somebody
Love somebody like you. Ooh
And I wanna love somebody
Love somebody like you, yeah
Oh yeah
Hey, I wanna love ya baby

[Guitar Solo + Banjo Solo]

[Outro]
Oh, I wanna be the man in the middle of the night
Shining like its true
I wanna be the man that you run to whenever I call on you
When everything that loved someone finally found its way
Wanna be a better man
I see it in you yeah
Hey, I wanna be that...[ “My Eyes”]

[Verse 1]
Those high heels with that sun dress
Turquoise heart hanging 'round your neck
Red lips like wine, want to drink them up
And keep on drinking' 'til you make me drunk

Tied up hair, want to let it down
And just let the rest fall to the ground
You take beautiful to the max
Can't help myself when you look like that

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you

[Verse 2]
There's a million stars dancing in the sky
A picture perfect moon so bright
But I don't care, I'm looking at you
From where I stand you can beat the view

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you

[Verse 3]
My eyes have seen
Some amazing things
But girl, my eyes aren’t seen
Nothing quite like you, hey baby

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sometimes it feels like this world's spinning faster
Than it did in the old days
So naturally, we have more natural disasters
From the strain of a fast pace
Sunday was a day of rest
Now, it's one more day for progress
And we can't slow down (and we can't slow down) 'cause more is less ('cause more is less)
It's all an endless process

[Chorus]
I miss Mayberry
Sittin' on the porch, drinkin' ice-cold cherry coke
Where everything is black and white
(Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na)
Pickin' on the six string
People pass by and you call them by their first name
Watchin' the clouds roll by
Bye, bye (Bye, bye)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I can hear this old earth shoutin'
Through the trees, as the wind blows
That's when I climb up here on this mountain
To look through God's window
Now I can't fly, but I got two feet
To get me high up here
Above the noise and city streets
My worries disappear

[Chorus]
I miss Mayberry
Sittin' on the porch, drinkin' ice-cold cherry coke
Where everything is black and white
(Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na)
Pickin' on the six string
People pass by and you call them by their first name
Watchin' the clouds roll by
Bye, bye (Bye)

[Bridge]
Sometimes I dream I'm drivin' down an old dirt road (Down an old dirt road)
Not even listed on a map (Ooh, yeah)
I pass a dad and son carrying a fishing pole
But I always wake up every time I try to turn back

[Chorus]
I miss Mayberry
Sittin' on the porch, drinkin' ice-cold cherry coke
Where everything is black and white
(Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na)
Pickin' on the six string
Where people pass by and you call them by their first name
Watchin' the clouds roll by
Bye, bye (Bye)
Bye, bye (Bye)

Some days it's tough just getting up
Throwing on these boots and making that climb
Some days I would rather be a no show or lay low
'Fore I go out of my mind

[Chorus]
But when she says baby (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby

[Verse 2]
Some nights I come home fighting mad
Feel like running my fist through the wall
Is it even worth what I'm fighting for anymore
Feeling torn, aw, to hell with it all

[Chorus]
But when she says baby (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby

[Bridge]
Everything gonna be alright
Just lay down by my side
Let me love you through this life

[Verse 3]
Yeah, she's a perfect shot of faith
When every bit of mine is gone
Something I can believe in, a best friend
A heaven sent love to lean on

[Chorus]
But when she says baby (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby

[Outro]
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy[Verse 1]
Well, you filled up my head with so many lies
You twisted my heart 'til something snapped inside
I'd like to give it one more try
But my give a damn's busted
You can crawl back home, say you were wrong
Stand out in the yard and cry all night long
Go ahead and water the lawn
My give a damn's busted

[Chorus]
I really wanna care
I wanna feel somethin'
Let me dig a little deeper
No, sorry, nothing

[Verse 2]
You can say you've got issues, you can say you're a victim
It's all your parents fault, I mean, after all, you didn't pick 'em
Maybe somebody else has got time to listen
My give a damn's busted
Well your therapist says it was all a mistake
A product of the Prozac and your codependent ways
So, who's your enabler these days?
My give a damn's busted

[Chorus]
I really wanna care
I wanna feel something
Let me dig a little deeper
No, still nothing

[Bridge]
It's a desperate situation, no tellin' what you'll do
If I don't forgive you, you say your life is through
C'mon, give me something I can use
My give a damn's busted
Well

[Chorus]
I really wanna care
I wanna feel something
Let me dig a little deeper
No, man, sorry

[Outro]
Just... nothing
No
You've really done it this time, ha ha
My give a damn's busted[Verse 1-Billy Currington]
Hey girl, what's your name girl
I've been looking at you
And every guy here's doing the same girl
It'd be a shame girl
If I let you just walk on by
Cause I'm all caught up in your sweet smile
A girl like you comes around once in a while
So hot, got to give it a shot
Gotta get get a little bit of what you got

[Chorus 1-Billy Currington]
I know you don't know me but I can't leave here lonely
Knowing I didn't even try to make you mine and
You might think I'm crazy
Girl but who could blame me
You're looking so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is

[Verse 2-Billy Currington]
Hey girl, what you think girl
You look a little thirsty let me go get you something to drink girl
Before you blink girl
I'll be right back by your side
And if you want we can roll out
I know my way around this town
I got a shotgun seat for you
You can tell me where it is you want to take off to

[Chorus 1-Billy Currington]
I know you don't know me but I can't leave here lonely
Knowing I didn't even try to make you mine and
You might think I'm crazy
Girl but who could blame me
You're looking so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is

[Bridge-Billy Currington]
Ooh, baby you're still standing here
I guess you must like what you hear
Hey girl, what you say girl
About you and me getting away girl

[Chorus 1-Billy Currington]
I know you don't know me but I can't leave here lonely
Knowing I didn't even try to make you mine and
You might think I'm crazy
Girl but who could blame me
You're looking so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is

[Outro-Billy Currington]
You're looking so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is
Hey girl
Oh yeah[Verse 1:]
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat
But always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed

I hope you still feel small
When you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes
I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

[Chorus:]
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

[Verse 2:]
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances
But they're worth taking
Loving might be a mistake
But it's worth making

Don't let some Hell-bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out
Reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

[Chorus:]
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

(Time is a wheel in constant motion
Always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
And wonder where those years have gone)

I hope you still feel small
When you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes
I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance

[Chorus:]
Dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

I said Grandpa what's this picture here
It's all black and white, and it ain't real clear
Is that you there, he said yeah, I was eleven
And times were tough, back in thirty-five
That's me and Uncle Joe just tryin' to survive
A cotton farm, in the Great Depression

[Refrain]
And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color

[Verse 2]
This one here was taken overseas
In the middle of hell, in nineteen forty-three
In the winter time, you can almost see my breath
That was my tail gunner ole' Johnny McGee
He was a high school teacher from New Orleans
And he had my back, right through the day we left

[Chorus]
And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color
A picture's worth a thousand words
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color

[Verse 3]
And this one is my favorite one
This is me and grandma in the, summer sun
All dressed up, the day we said our vows
You can't tell it here but it was hot that June
And that rose was red and her eyes were blue
And just look at that smile, I was so proud

[Bridge]
That's the story of my life
Right there in black and white

[Chorus]
And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color
Yeah, a picture's worth a thousand words
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color

[Outro]
Should've seen it in color[Verse 1: Kid Rock]
Living my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fueling up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord, I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

[Hook: Kid Rock]
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her

[Verse 2: Sheryl Crow]
I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows, but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waiting on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

[Hook: Sheryl Crow]
I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him
I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

[Verse 3: Sheryl Crow & Kid Rock, Both]
I saw you yesterday with an old friend
It was the same old same, how have you been?
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey
You reminded me of brighter days
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drink you away
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

[Chorus: Kid Rock & Sheryl Crow]
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home

[Outro: Kid Rock & Sheryl Crow]
I just called to say I love you
Come back home

[Verse 1]
Ever since you left me
I've been ridin' 'round, cranking up a little country gold heartbreak
Cried and dried these tears
I don't know how much more missin' you I can take

[Pre-Chorus]
I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

[Chorus]
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

[Verse 2]
I take a shot of I don't care what you're doing now
Chase that one with a cold screw you
When that's done, I just might wash it down
With a big pitcher of someone new

[Pre-Chorus 2]
That blond blonde blonde
At the bar, bar, bar
See if she wants to try and unbreak my heart, heart, heart

[Chorus]
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

[Verse 3]
When we were together
I thought life would suck forever
Even though I knew better than the pain would never end
They say the night's darkest just before the dawn
Gets kissed by the day break, got down on my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
And I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

[Chorus]
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel[Verse 1]
Don't you worry 'bout gettin' fixed up
When you wake up, you're pretty enough
Look out your window at the cloud of dust
That's my headlights, that's my truck

[Verse 2]
Come on baby, don't you keep me waitin'
I gotta go, I've got a reservation
Tailgate for two underneath the stars
Kiss on your lips when you're in my arms

[Bridge]
Whoa girl, every now and then you get a night like this
Whoa, this is one that we don't wanna miss, no

[Chorus]
Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knocking on midnight
Me and you girl runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby, all we got is all night
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight

[Verse 3]
Girl I bet you thought I lost my mind
Outta the blue pulling into your drive
Wonder why I got you way out here
Have you ever seen a sky this clear

[Bridge]
Whoa girl, you never look better than you do right now
Whoa oh heaven, let your light shine down

[Chorus]
Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knocking on midnight

All I wanna do is hold you tight
Come on, come on, come on we're runnin' outta moonlight

Whoa
Yeah, we're runnin' outta moonlight
Whoa[Verse: 1]
So I guess it's over, baby
Déjà vu again
Who'd have thought that time don't stop?
And somehow girl, the world keeps spinning
And guess I've turned myself into a solitary man
Ain't like I'm the only one that's in the shoes that I am

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

[Verse 2]
I know that it might sound jaded
And I have to say
I think love is overrated
But I don't like throwing it away
I know you could probably tell me right where I went wrong
Some guys can't have all the luck if others don't sing sad songs

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned

That's right
Another lover
Another lover, crash and burn
Ooh, yeah

Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
Yeah, I let another lover crash and burn[Verse 1]
I wasn't born for digging deep holes
I'm not made for paving long roads
I ain't cut out to climb high line poles
But I'm pretty good at drinking beer

I'm not the type to work in a bank
I'm no good at slapping on paint
Don't have a knack for making motors crank, no
But I'm pretty good at drinking beer

I like 'em cold and tall

I ain't much for mowing thick grass
I'm too slow for working too fast
I don't do windows so honey don't ask
But I'm pretty good at drinking beer

[Verse 4]
A go getter maybe I'm not
I'm not known for doing a lot
But I do my best work when the weather's hot
But I'm pretty good at drinking beer

So hand me one more
That's what I'm here for

That's what I'm here for[Verse 1]
My daddy spent his life looking up at the sky
He'd cuss, kick the dust, saying son it's way too dry
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing

[Hook]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

[Verse 2]
Aren’t nothing like a kiss out back in the barn
Ringing out our soaking clothes, riding out a thunderstorm
When tin roof gets to talking, that's the best love we made
Yeah where I come from, rain is a good thing

[Hook]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck

Rain is a good thing

Rain is a good thing

[Outro]
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing[Verse 1]
Sitting on a bench at West Town Mall
He sat down in his overalls and asked me
You Waiting on a woman
I nodded yeah and said how 'bout you
He said son since nineteen fifty-two I've been
Waiting on a woman

[Verse 2]
When I picked her up for our first date
I told her I'd be there at eight
And she came down the stairs at eight-thirty
She said I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on
But let me tell you son she sure looked pretty
Yeah she'll take her time but I don't mind
Waiting on a woman

[Verse 3]
He said the wedding took a year to plan
You talk about an anxious man, I was nervous
Waiting on a woman
And then he nudged my arm like old men do
And said, I'll say this about the honeymoon, it was worth it
Waiting on a woman

[Verse 4]
And I don't guess we've been anywhere
She hasn't made us late I swear
Sometimes she does it just cause she can do it
Boy it's just a fact of life
It'll be the same with your young wife
Might as well go on and get used to it
She'll take her time because you don't mind
Waiting on a woman

[Verse 5]
I've read somewhere statistics show
The man's always the first to go
And that makes sense cause I know she won't be ready
So when it finally comes my time
And I get to the other side
I'll find myself a bench, if they've got any
I hope she takes her time, cause I don't mind
Waiting on a woman

[Outro]
Honey, take your time, cause I don't mind
Waiting on a woman[Verse 1]
A yellow two piece, black Ray Bans
Your bare feet covered in sand
White jet trails across the blue sky
Your ponytail showing off the sunshine
Like a postcard, out of nowhere
You get to me, you give me that smile and

[Chorus]
I'm somewhere, somewhere sunny and 75
You and me on a beach chair
Yeah, I'm so there every time I look in your eyes
Kissing you and the salt air
I can taste it, I swear
Take me somewhere sunny and 75

[Verse 2]
It doesn't take much for you to move me
Just the way you're leaning into me
It's a holiday when we're together
I wanna stay with you forever

[Chorus]
Somewhere, somewhere sunny and 75
You and me on a beach chair
Yeah, I'm so there every time I look in your eyes
Kissing you and the salt air
I can taste it, I swear
Take me somewhere sunny and 75

[Bridge]
You're like the fast lane West bound
You feel like a windows rolled down
I can't wait until we get there, somewhere

[Chorus]
Somewhere sunny and 75
You and me on a beach chair
Yeah, I'm so there every time I look in your eyes
Kissing you and the salt air
I can taste it, I swear
Take me somewhere sunny and 75[Verse 1]
I've been a walking heartache
I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Ain’t who I want to be
But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through
And I need you

[Chorus]
'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you
Gave me you

[Verse 2]
There's more here than what we’re seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
And I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you
Yeah!

[Chorus]
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

[Verse 3]
On my own, I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo

[Chorus]
'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you, gave me you
He gave me you[Verse 1]
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Bridge]
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
"When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"

[Chorus]
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me
Mmmm

[Outro]
He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"[Verse 1]
Raymond's in his Sunday best, he's usually up to his chest
In oil and grease
There's the Martin's walking in, with that mean little freckle-faced kid
Who broke a window last week

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off-key in the pew behind me

[Chorus 1]
That's what I love about Sunday
Sing along as the choir sways
Every verse of Amazing Grace
And then we shake the preacher's hand
Go home, into your blue jeans
Have some chicken and some baked beans
Pick a backyard football team
Not do much of anything
That's what I love about Sunday

[Verse 2]
I stroll to the end of the drive, pick up the Sunday Times
Grab a coffee cup
It looks like Sally and Ron, finally tied the knot
Well, it's about time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's thirty-five cents off of ground round, baby, cut that coupon out

[Chorus 2]
That's what I love about Sunday
Cat-napping on the porch swing
You curled up next to me
The smell of jasmine wakes us up
Take a walk down a back road
Tackle box and a cane pole
Carve our names in that white oak
And steal a kiss as the sun fades
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Ooh, new believers getting baptized
Momma's hands raised up high
Ain't it a Hallelujah good time
A smile on everybody's face
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah

[Outro]
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah[Verse 1]
A woman is mystery
A man just can't understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand
And other times you got to take it slow
And hold her all night long
Heaven knows there's so many ways
A man can go wrong

[Chorus]
Must be doing something right
I just heard you sigh
You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doing something right

[Verse 2]
Anywhere you want to go
Baby, show me the way
I'm open to suggestions
Mmm, whatever you say
Tonight's about giving you
What you want, whatever it takes
Girl, I hope I'm on the right road
And judging by the smile on your face

[Chorus]
Must be doing something right
I just heard you sigh
You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doing something right

[Bridge]
Ah, Baby
Mmm

[Outro]
I don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doin' something right
Must be doin' something right[Verse 1]
I saw a truck backing out of your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messing with the radio, you had your sun glasses on
I pulled over cause I couldn’t believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, singing our songs
Now everybody round our town's been whispering
A tear in your eye says I should have been listening

[Chorus]
Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

[Verse 2]
You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I aren’t leaving till I hear you say what’s going on
It’ll be what it will be, its either him or me
Give me the word and girl I’m gone

[Chorus]
Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

[Outro]
No goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
No, don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
Is someone else calling you baby?[Verse 1]
You slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt
You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind
You keep on flirtin', 'cause you know that it's workin'
You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried
Let's light it up like it's our last night

[Chorus]
We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down

[Verse 2]
Girl when you want it
You know that I'm on it
You know that I love lovin' up on you
Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance
And light it up like it's our last chance

[Chorus]
We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here dreamin' in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down

[Bridge]
I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me (with me)
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me (against me)
I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me (with me)
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me  (against me)

[Chorus]
We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down

[Outro]
I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me (with me)
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me[Intro]
Ooh, yeah
Woo, yeah
Yeah oh yeah

[Verse 1]
The only ground I ever owned was stickin' to my shoes
Now I look at my front porch at this panoramic view
I can sit and watch the fields fill up with rays of golden sun
Or watch the moon lay on the fences like that's where it was hung

[Pre-Chorus]
My blessings aren't in front of me
It's not about the land
I'll never beat the view
Of my front porch looking in

[Chorus]
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

[Verse 2]
I've traveled here and everywhere following my job
I've seen the paintings from the air brushed by the hand of God
The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea
But I can't wait to get back home to the one He made for me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause anywhere I'll ever go
And everywhere I've been
Nothing takes my breath away
Like my front porch looking in

[Chorus]
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

[Bridge]
I've seen what beautiful is about
When I'm looking in
Not when I'm looking out

[Chorus]
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Oh, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in, yeah

Oh, there's a carrot top who can barely walk
(From my front porch looking in)
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong, yeah
And the most beautiful girl holding both of them, oh, yeah
(Beautiful girl)

[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton]
You can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby I’ll do whatever you wanna do

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

[Bridge: Blake Shelton]
Have a night that you'll never forget
And now you're standing in the neon
Looking like a high I wanna be on

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did[Verse 1]
I should've known by the way you passed me by
There was something in your eyes, and it wasn't right
I should've walked, but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand, and I let it slide

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way
It was before I saw your face

[Chorus]
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 2]
Now your photos don't have a picture frame
And I never say your name, and I never will
And all your things, well, I threw 'em in the trash
And I'm not even sad

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now you only have yourself to blame
For playing all those stupid games
You're always gonna be the same
Oh no, you'll never change

[Chorus]
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na na

[Bridge]
You want my future, you can't have it
I'm still trying to erase you from my past
I need you gone so fast

[Chorus]
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack

I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

I've got some big news
The bank finally came through
And I'm holding the keys to a brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires

[Chorus]
Cause it's a good night
To be out there soaking up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires

[Verse 2]
Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count on a night this clear

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell you what we need to do is grab a sleeping bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires

[Chorus]
Cause it's a good night
To be out there soaking up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires

[Outro]
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires[Verse 1]
Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, four wheel drivesiIn a tail light circle
Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a dixie cup
Get the party started

[Chorus]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

[Verse 2]
If you ain't a 10, you're a 9.9
Tippin' n' spillin' that home-made wine
On your tied up T-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God almighty

[Chorus]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

[Bridge]
Let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off on out in the water

[Chorus]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm a little drunk on you[Verse 1]
There's still black marks on that county road
Where we drag raced our pick-ups and Mustangs
And weathered all the sun and rain
And to this day up on that overpass
Even underneath the new paint, you can still see
"Allie, will you marry me?"

[Interlude]
Take a ride, look around
There ain't no doubt

[Chorus]
It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down, like tattoos on this town

[Verse 2]
There's still a rope burn on that old branch, that hangs over the river
I still got the scar
From swinging out a little too far
There ain't a corner of this hallow ground
That we don't laughed or cried on
It's where we loved, lived and learned real life stuff
It's everything we're made of

[Chorus]
It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down, like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town

[Bridge]
Everywhere, there we are
It hits me right in my heart

[Verse 3]
It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down
And we'll always be hanging around
Like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town[Verse 1]
We drove right past
That no trespassing sign
We sat on the tailgate
And watched the planes take off
We thought we had all night
There was no need to rush
That's when those cops
Came pulling up
And I thought
Man, ain't this some shhhh

[Pre-Chorus]
Your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah I know it sounds crazy

[Chorus]
But there was something 'bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

[Verse 2]
Man, they weren't playing
They sure threw those cuffs on quick
You tried to sweet talk 'em
They didn't fall for it
But I did
You were on the left
I was on the right
I knew you didn't smoke
When you asked him for a light
And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door

[Pre-Chorus]
I swear your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah I know it sounds crazy

[Chorus]
But there was something 'bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
Ohh, and you were like

[Bridge]
Side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind
We talked
And we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone

[Chorus]
But there was something 'bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

[Outro]
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
A side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind
We talked
And we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone
I was already gone baby
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

Songwriter:  Sam Hunt[Verse 1]
Said I was in my early 40's
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days, lookin' at the x-rays
Talkin' 'bout the options and talkin' 'bout sweet time
Asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya, when you get that kind of news
Man what ya do
And he says

[Chorus 1]
I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

[Verse 2]
He said I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all the sudden goin' fishing
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do
If I could do it all again
And then

[Chorus 1]
I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

[Bridge]
Like tomorrow was a gift and you've got eternity
To think about what you do with it
What could you do with it, what can
I do with with it, what would I do with it

[Chorus 2]
Sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

[Outro]
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'[Intro]
DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DE-DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DAA-DAAAAA
DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DE-DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DAA-DAA-DAA-DAA-DAAAA!

[Verse 1]
Well, I walk into the room
Passing out hundred dollar bills
And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill
And I buy the bar a double round of  Crown
And everybody's getting down
An' this town ain't never gonna be the same

[Chorus:]
Cause I saddle up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy

Well I don't give a dang about nothing
I'm singing and Bling-Blinging
While the girls are drinking
Long necks down!
And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy
Or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
Or your freak parade
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town

And I saddle up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy

[Spoken:]
I'm a thourough-bred
That's what she said
In the back of my truck bed
As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
Out on some back country road
We where flying high
Fine as wine, having ourselves a big and rich time
And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go

But her evaluation
Of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for salvation
All night long
So I took her out giggin frogs
Introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Wilie Nelson song I could think of
And we made love

And I saddled up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy

What? What?
Save A Horse Ride A Cowboy
Everybody says
Save a Horse Ride a cowboyIt was the summer before the real world started and
The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running
Daddy’s old Winnebago

Wing and a prayer down 65
Five best friends on four bald tires
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it

To Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

Like a storm, time rolls on
You can’t hit pause, that's just the deal
Most days in life don’t stand out
But life’s about those days that we all like

Rocking Randall
Getting rowdy
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon
‘til the Alabama sun was breaking

Over Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

When the winds go cold
And it blows October
I think about us shoulder to shoulder
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over
In my mind

Tonight I’m in Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

Talladega
Talladega[Verse 1]
If I could write a letter to me
And send it back in time to myself at seventeen
First I'd prove it's me by sayin' look under your bed
There's a Skoal can and a Playboy no one else would know you hid
And then I'd say I know it's tough
When you break up after seven months
And yeah, I know you really liked her and it just don't seem fair
But all I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare

[Chorus]
And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
She wasn't right for you and still you feel like there's a knife
Stickin' out of your back and you're wonderin' if you'll survive
But you'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me

[Verse 2]
At the stop sign at Tomlinson and Eighth
Always stop completely, don't just tap your brakes
And when you get a date with Bridgett, make sure the tank is full
On second thought forget it, that one turns out kinda cool
Each and every time you have a fight
Just assume you're wrong and dad is right
And you should really thank Mrs. Brinkman, she spends so much extra time
It's like she sees the diamond underneath and she's polishing you 'til you shine

[Chorus 2]
And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
Tonight's the bonfire rally but you're stayin' home instead
Because if you fail Algebra, mom and dad will kill you dead
Trust me you'll squeak by and get a C
And you're still around to write this letter to me

[Verse 3]
You've got so much up ahead, you'll make new friends
You should see your kids and wife
And I'd end up sayin' have no fear
These are nowhere near the best years of your life

[Bridge]
I guess I'll see you in the mirror, when you're a grown man
P.S.: Go hug Aunt Rita every chance you can

[Chorus]
And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
I wish you'd study Spanish, I wish you'd taken typin' class
I wish you wouldn't worry, let it be, hey I'd say have a little faith and you'll see

[Outro]
If I could write a letter to me
To me[Intro]
Kick the dust up, c'mon

[Verse 1]
All week long it’s a farmin’ town
They’re makin’ that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin’ up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on
Girl kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac

[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (kick the dust up...)

[Verse 2]
Bar downtown they got a line
Of people way out the door
$10 dollar drinks, it’s packed inside
I don’t know what they’re waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ears
And it’s like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (c'mon)

[Bridge]
Just follow me down ‘neath the 32 bridge
Y'all be glad you did (kick it)

[Chorus 2]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
That’s what’s up, up
Let’s kick the dust up[Verse 1]
A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirty-thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma

[Verse 2]
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man, it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?

[Verse 3]
They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those flyover states

[Verse 4]
I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat

[Verse 5]
On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a water-colored painted sky

You'll think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Those flyover states

[Verse 6]
Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
And meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those flyover states
(Yeah)

[Outro]
Have you ever been through Indiana?
On the plains of Oklahoma?
Take a ride[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
The joke's on me and it ain't funny
Everybody but me could see the punch line coming
A mile away
I've heard it so many times I can tell it
To the T, believe me I could sell it
All day
It goes...

[Chorus]
A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

[Verse 2]
I'd laugh too if my heart would let me
Keeping it light will probably help to get me
Over you
I'm walking, talking, drinking proof
A cliché in a corner booth
Ain't nothing new

[Chorus]
A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]
Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're going way too fast
You're trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
You're trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh, baby

[Chorus:Tim McGraw]
The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw & Taylor Swift]
I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me
You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
You're trying not to think about turning around
You're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

[Chorus: Tim McGraw]
The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

[Bridge: Tim McGraw & Taylor Swift]
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, babyWell the truth
Well it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags
And I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split
I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit
Ain't never comin back
But before I get to goin' I've got to say
I know you used to love me
But that was yesterday
And the truth, I won't fight it
When the love starts burnin you got to do whats right

Woah, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Woah, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more

Well the truth
Yeah, it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags
And I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split
I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit
Ain't never comin back
But before I get to going
There was a time oh woman
When you used to shake it for me
Now all you do is treat me cold
Ain't gonna take it no more
Gonna walk out the door

Lover, lover, lover
You dont treat me no good no more
No, no, more more more
Woah, lover lover lover

Woman oh woman
You know I love you so
You're just so mean to me baby Im walkin out the door

Lover oh lover
I know you used to love me in every way, but now I'm givin up

Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more[Verse 1]
Damn, I used to love this view
Sit here and drink a few
Main street and the high school lit up on Friday night
Down there it's another touchdown
Man, this year's team is stout
I can hear them going crazy
And up here so am I
Thinking about you sitting there saying I hate this, I hate it
If you couldn't stand living here why'd you take it, take it

[Chorus]
Give me back my hometown
Cause this is my hometown

[Verse 2]
All the colors of my youth
The red, the green, the hope, the truth
Are beating me black and blue cause you're in every scene
My friends try to cheer me up, get together at the Pizza Hut
I didn't have the heart to tell them that was our place
These sleepy streetlights on every sidewalk side street
Shed a light on everything that used to be

[Chorus]
Give me back my hometown
Cause this is my hometown
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
You can have my grandma's locket
The knife out of my grandpa's pocket
Yeah my state champion jacket
I don't care you can have it
Every made memory
Every picture, every broken dream
Yeah everything, everything, everything

[Chorus]
Give me back my hometown
Cause this is my hometown
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
She put him out
Like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night...

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss ]
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, "I'll love her 'til I die"
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

[Break: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa

[Verse 2: Alison Krauss]
The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night...

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

[Outro: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa[Verse 1]
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone."

[Chorus 2]
You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (See it now)[Verse 1]
We got winners, we got losers
Chain smokers and boozers
And we got yuppies, we got bikers
We got thirsty hitchhikers
And the girls next door dress up like movie stars

Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar

[Verse 2]
We got cowboys, we got truckers
Broken-hearted fools and suckers
And we got hustlers, we got fighters
Early birds and all-nighters
And the veterans talk about their battle scars

Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar

[Hook]
I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just walkin' through the front door
Puts a big smile on my face
It ain't too far, come as you are
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar

[Verse 3]
I've seen short skirts, we got high-techs
Blue-collar boys and rednecks
And we got lovers, lots of lookers
And I've even seen dancing girls and hookers
And we like to drink our beer from a mason jar

Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
Yes I do

[Bridge]
I like my truck (I like my truck)
I like my girlfriend (I like my girlfriend)
I like to take her out to dinner
I like a movie now and then

But I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just trollin' around the dance floor
Puts a big smile on my face
No cover charge, come as you are
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar

We got divorcees and a big bouncer man
An old jukebox and a real bad band
We got waitresses and we got barflies
A dumb-ass and a wise-guy
If you get too drunk just sleep out in your car
Reason number 672 why
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
Play it on out boys
Beer-thirty's over
Got to take it on home
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
I just love it[Verse 1]
You only love me for my big sunglasses
And my Tony Lamas
And my Dodge Dart Classic
You said "I'll be Johnny and you'll be June
I'll ride with you to the moon"
But guess what?

[Chorus]
You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ohhhh
Ahhhh
Ohhhh
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Oh, heaven help me
I been sowwin' wildflower seeds
And chasin' tumbleweeds
But that's just who I be
And you're just tryin' to slow this rolling stone
But I'm on to you babe
So guess what?

[Chorus]
You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ohhhh
Ahhhh
Ohhhh
Ahh

[Bridge]
Oh, you only love me for my big sunglasses and my Tony Lamas
I live in Oklahoma
And I've got long, blonde hair
And I play guitar and I go on the road
And I do all the shit you wanna do
And my dog does tricks
And I ain't about drama y'all
I love my apron
But I ain't your momma
So guess what?
What?!

[Chorus]
You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ohhhh
Ahhhh
Ohhhh
Ahh[Verse 1]
I haven't seen you in forever
Oh you haven't changed a bit
You didn't think that I would remember
How could I forget

[Chorus]
We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something that just don't happen twice

[Verse 2]
To this day I still taste that first kiss
How I prayed it wouldn't end
In a way, seeing you like this
I guess it never really did

[Chorus]
We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something that just don't happen twice

[Verse 3]
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something, baby that's something
Oh that's something
That just don't happen twice

[Outro]
Oh yeah

We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
Yeah we fell in love[Verse 1]
I never had no one, that I could count on
I've been let down so many times
And I was tired of hurtin', so tired of searchin'
Till you walked into my life
It was a feeling, I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
You stand by me, and you believe in me
Like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy, you're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have
And I still tremble, when we touch
And, oh, the look in your eyes, when we make love

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend, ooh-oh oh
You're my best friend

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend (my best friend)
You're my best friend (my best friend)[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I hope that the days come easy and the moments pass slow
And each road leads you where you wanna go
And if you're faced with a choice and you have to choose
I hope you choose the one that means the most to you
And if one door opens to another door closed
I hope you keep on walkin' 'till you find the window
If it's cold outside
Show the world the warmth of your smile
But more than anything
More than anything

[Chorus]
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too
Yeah, this is my wish

[Verse 2]
I hope you never look back, but you never forget
All the ones who love you, in the place you left
I hope you always forgive, and you never regret
And you help somebody every chance you get
Oh, you find God's grace in every mistake
And always give more than you take
But more than anything (More)
Yeah, more than anything

[Chorus]
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too
Yeah, this is my wish
Yeah, yeah

My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small
You never need to carry more than you can hold
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to
I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too
Yeah, this is my wish (My wish, for you)

[Outro]
This is my wish (My wish, for you)
I hope you know somebody loves you (My wish, for you)
May all your dreams stay big (My wish, for you)[Verse 1]
Pair of boots and a sack of clothes
Free and easy down the road I go
Hanging memories on the high line poles
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go

[Verse 2]
Ragweed's rocking on the radio
Free and easy down the road I go
So I keep rolling like an old banjo
Free and easy down the road I go

[Bridge 1]
Got the sun shining on me like a big spotlight
So I know everything is gonna be alright

[Chorus]
Ain't no telling where the wind might blow
Free and easy down the road I go
Living life like a Sunday stroll
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go

[Bridge 2]
If you only get to go around one time
I'm gonna sit back and try to enjoy the ride

[Verse 3]
I could make a million or wind up broke
Free and easy down the road I go
Can't take it with you when you go so

[Chorus]
Free and easy down the road I go
Someday I know it's going to take me home so
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go[Verse 1]
Had a nice little life
A little boat a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew

[Chorus]
There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all all by yourself
Something's always missing
Till you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well

[Verse 2]
Till you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you


[Chorus]Sit in that six-lane backed up traffic
Horns are honking, I've about had it
I'm looking for an exit sign
Gotta get out of here, get it all off my mind
And like a memory from your grandpa's attic
A song comes slippin' through the radio static
Changing my mood
A little George Strait 1982

And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road

I've been cooped up, tied down, 'bout forgotten
What a field looks like, full of corn and cotton
If I'm gonna hit a traffic jam
Well it better be a tractor man
So sick and tired of this interstate system
I need a curve and wind-a-twistin'
Dusty path to nowhere
With the wind blowing through my baby's hair

Yeah, makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road

Maybe it's the feeling or maybe it's the freedom
Maybe it's that shady spot
Where we park the truck when the things get hot
Where we park the truck when the things get hot

And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab you honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road, get right with my soul
Now all I gotta do is take some old back road
(Some old back road) to the shady spot where things get hot
(Some old back road) way down, way down
Way down some old back road[Verse 1]
I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl, I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

[Chorus]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

[Verse 2]
And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

[Chorus 2]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

[Bridge]
I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you

[Chorus 3]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time[Verse 1]
Looking back now, well it makes me laugh
We were growing our hair, we were cutting class
Knew it all already, there was nothing to learn
We were striking matches just to watch them burn
Listen to our music just a little too loud
We were hanging in there with the outcast crowd
Heading to the rapids with some discount beer
It was a long train tussle but we had no fear

[Chorus]
Man I don't know, where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, and we were mostly
Young

[Verse 2]
Talked a good game when we were out with the guys
But in the back seat we were awkward and shy
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain
And I guess there are some things that are never going to change

[Chorus]
Man I don't know, where the time goes
But It sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young
Young, Young, Yeah Wishing we were older
Young, Hey I wish it wasn't over

[Chorus]
Man I don't know, where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, and we were mostly
Young[Verse 1]
I got smoke in my hair
My clothes thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rocking chair
Holding a beer in my hand
Sporting a neon tan

[Verse 2]
My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club
Ain't got a clue what went down
So I started calling around

[Chorus]
And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 3]
I found my billfold
I cried oh no no
Good time Charlie got me now I'm broke
But it was worth acting like a fool
Yeah girl I must have really showed you

[Chorus]
Cause all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Bridge]
I was Elvis rocking on the bar
Working the crowd pouring out my heart

[Chorus]
And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
Raise 'em up
I'm talkin' 'bout a lighter on a Saturday night
The band plays a song you like and you sing along
Raise em up
I'm talkin' 'bout Daddy's old pickup truck
Shotgun seat, there's the one you love and you're kissin' on

[Chorus: Eric Church & Keith Urban]
Get those white sails sailing down in Mexico
It's just a whiskey glass if you ain't makin' a toast
Lift your tear-filled eyes up to the sky
A comin' home, you've been gone too long
Tonight were gonna
Raise 'em up

[Verse 2: Eric Church]
Raise 'em up
You got a voice, you got a choice
Go make some noise
Don't ever let 'em tell you who you are
Raise 'em up
Fist black and blue, fight for the truth
Its what you do
Hand on your heart for the stripes and stars

[Chorus: Eric Church & Keith Urban]
Black umbrellas in the pourin' rain
A Sunday Morning Coming Down, Amazing Grace
Lift those tear-filled eyes up to the sky
As the flag flies, say goodbye
Tonight were gonna
Raise 'em up

[Verse 3: Keith Urban]
So, you meet someone
The only one
You take her by the hand
Make a stand
Buy some land
Make some love
And them babies come

[Chorus: Eric Church & Keith Urban]
Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up trophy high
Raise 'em up to the sky
Raise 'em up, show everybody that newborn smile
Raise 'em up tall and strong
Raise 'em up right from wrong
Raise 'em up so damn high they can hear God singing along
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah[Verse 1]
I see main street closing
Miles of “for sale” signs
And them fields ain’t growing
Fast enough to get us by
I feel the sweet release
Of a Friday night
For a couple of hours we can run this town
Till it runs dry

[Chorus]
Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off of your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back

[Verse 2]
So grab the girl you came with
And set her world on fire
And watch her sway and singing to the music
Until it’s all alright
Yeah

[Chorus]
Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off of your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back

[Verse 3]
I don’t wanna lose this feeling
And I don’t wanna close my eyes
I don’t wanna remember what I’m here to forget tonight
So tip it on back

[Chorus]
Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off of your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back

[Verse 4]
Yeah, I don’t wanna lose this feeling
I don’t wanna close my eyes
I don’t wanna remember what i’m here to forget tonight
So tip it on back
Just tip it on back

[Outro]
Feel the sweet release of a friday night
For a couple of hours we can run this town
Till it runs dry
Tip it on back[Verse 1]
It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

[Chorus]
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, "You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides"
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

[Verse 2]
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

[Chorus]
It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right
He'd say "A little slower son, you're doing just fine"
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

[Bridge]
I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

[Chorus]
It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say "Turn it left" and "Steer it right"
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive

[Outro]
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke[Verse 1]
County road 233, under my feet
Nothing on this white rock but little ol’ me
I've got two miles 'till he makes bail
And if I'm right, we're headed straight for hell

[Chorus]
I'm going home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead

[Verse 2]
Well, it's half past ten, another six-pack in
And I can feel the rumble like a cold black wind
He pulls in the drive, the gravel flies
He don't know what's waitin' here this time

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm going home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead

[Bridge]
His fist is big, but my gun's bigger
He'll find out when I pull the trigger

[Chorus]
I'm going home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and, gunpowder and lead
Gunpowder and lead, yeah, yeah, hey[Verse 1]
Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm

[Verse 2]
Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah
Mmm

[Bridge]
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace

[Chorus 2]
Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man
Mmm[Verse 1]
Tuxedo waiters, black tie
White table cloths and red wine
We've been planning, this night
Looking forward to it, for some time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now honey I know you love gettin' dressed up
And you know I love showin' you off
But watchin' your baby blue eyes
Dancin' in the candle light glow
All I can think about, is gettin' you home

[Chorus]
Walkin' through the front door
Seein' your black dress hit the floor
Uh, honey, there sure ain't nothin', like you lovin' me all night long
And all I can think about is gettin' you home

[Verse 2]
I don't need this menu, no I don't
I already know just what I want
Did I hear you right, did you tell me
Go pay the waiter and lets leave

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now honey I know by that look in your eyes
And your hand drawin' hearts on mine
That our night out of the house, ain't gonna last too long
When all you can think about, is gettin' me home

[Chorus]
Walkin' through the front door
Seein' your black dress hit the floor
Uh, honey, there sure ain't nothin', like you lovin' me all night long
And all I can think about, is gettin' you home

[Outro]
Walkin' through the front door
Seein' your black dress hit the floor
Uh, honey, there sure ain't nothin' like you loving me all night long
And all I can think about, all I can think about
All I can think about, is gettin' you home[Verse 1]
I am insensitive, I have a tendency to
Pay more attention to the things that I need
Sometimes I drink to much, sometimes I test your trust
Sometimes I don't know why you're staying with me

[Chorus]
I'm hard to love, hard to love,  no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good

[Verse 2]
I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning, full of grace and full of Jesus
I wish that I could be more like you

[Chorus]
I'm hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
Love me good

[Bridge]
Girl you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted
I'm just a man, I'm just a man

[Chorus]
Hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Good

[Outro]
You love me good[Verse 1]
Whoo um, yeah
Life is like a road that you travel on
When there is one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There is a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

[Verse 2]
Through all these cities and all these towns
It is in my blood and it is all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down get back up again
You are in my blood
I am not a lonely man
There is no load I cannot hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Give me give me give me give me yeah

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

[Refrain]
There was a distance between you and I (Between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Ooh, yeah
There ain't no load that I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we're survivors

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Give me give me give me give me yeah[Verse 1]
These old boots still got a lot of ground
They ain't covered yet
There's at least another million miles
Under these old bus treads
So if you think I'm going to settle down
I've got news for you

[Chorus 1]
I still got a lot of leaving left to do

[Verse 2]
And as long as there's a song
Left in this old guitar
This life I'm bound to lead
Ain't for the faint of heart
So you won't fall for me
If you know what's good for you

[Chorus 1]
Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do

[Chorus 2]
I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So loving me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose

[Chorus 1]
Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do

[Verse 3]
Girl, you look like you might be an angel
So I won't lie
I could love you like the devil
If you wanted me to tonight
And we could talk about forever for a day or two

[Chorus 1]
But I still got a lot of leaving left to do

[Chorus 2]
I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So loving me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose

[Chorus 1]
Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do
I still got a lot of leaving left to do[Verse 1]
Don't you remember
The fizz in a pepper
Peanuts in a bottle
At ten, two and four
A fried bologna sandwich
With mayo and tomato
Sittin' round the table
Do not happen much anymore

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We got too complicated
It's all way over-rated
I like the old and out-dated
Way of life

[Chorus]
Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

[Verse 2]
I love my records
Black, shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops
And white noise
Man they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations
The ones that played 'em all
Country, soul and rock-n-roll
What happened to those times

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I am reading Street Slang For Dummies
'Cause they put pop in my country
I want more for my money
The way it was back then

[Chorus]
Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

[Bridge]
Give me a flat top for strummin'
I want the whole world to be hummin'
Oh, just keep it comin'
The way it was back then

[Chorus]
Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when[Verse 1]
Hey pretty girl, won't you look my way
Love's in the air tonight
You can bet you make this ol' boy's day
Hey pretty girl, won't you look my way

[Verse 2]
Hey pretty girl, can I have this dance
And the next one after that
Gonna make you mine there's a real good chance
Hey pretty girl, can I have this dance

[Verse 3]
Hey pretty girl, it feels so right
Just like it's meant to be
All wrapped up in my arms so tight
Hey pretty girl, it feels so right

[Hook]
Life's a long and winding ride
Better have the right one by your side
And happiness don't drag its feet
Time moves faster than you think

[Verse 4]
Hey pretty girl, wanna take you home
My momma's gonna love you
She'll make me sleep on the couch, I know
Hey pretty girl, wanna take you home

[Verse 5]
Hey pretty girl, let's build some dreams
And a house on a piece of land
We'll plant some roots and some apple trees
Hey pretty girl, let's build some dreams

[Hook]
Life's a long and winding ride
Better have the right one by your side
And happiness don't drag its feet
Time moves faster than you think

[Verse 6]
Hey pretty girl, you did so good
Our baby's got your eyes
And a fighter's heart like I knew she would
Hey pretty girl, you did so good

[Verse 7]
Hey pretty girl, when I see the light
And it's my time to go
I'm gonna thank the Lord for a real good life
A pretty little girl and a beautiful wife[Verse 1]
You're on the couch, blowing up my phone
You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soiree
If you're in the mood, sit tight right where you are, babe

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you

[Chorus]
We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down

[Post-Chorus]
If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

[Verse 3]
Throw a neon t-shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shaking the floor, rattling the roof
We'll go to town right there in your living room

[Chorus]
Let's have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down

[Post-Chorus]
If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

[Bridge]
So I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, baby, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you

[Chorus]
We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down

[Post-Chorus]
If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party[Verse 1]
Tell 'em all I'm on vacation
Say I went to visit friends
That you ain't heard or seen from me in quite a while
When they ask you where I've been
Tell 'em I'm out on the West Coast
Where it don't ever rain
And that I'm probably doing fine

[Chorus]
Just don't tell 'em I've gone crazy
That I'm still strung out over you
Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth

[Verse 2]
Tell 'em all I'm out in Vegas
Blowing every dollar I ever made
Tell 'em that I must be into something bad for me
'Cause I sure lost a lot of weight
Tell 'em I'm out on the road
With some old rock and roll band
Living like a gypsy can

[Chorus]
Just don't tell 'em I've gone crazy
That I'm still strung out over you
Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth

[Bridge]
The truth is that I'm asking you to lie
And we both know that it ain't right
But if you ever loved me
Please have some mercy on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth
I still need you

[Outro]
Yeah, that's the truth
I still love you
Baby, that's the truth[Verse 1]
First I get cold and hot
Think I'm on fire, but I'm not
Oh, what a pain I've got
It must be love
There's nothing I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm going through
It must be love

[Chorus]
It must be love, it must be love
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
Oh what a feeling, it must be love

[Verse 2]
Something is wrong or right
I think of you all night
Can't sleep 'til morning light
It must be loveSeeing you in my dreams
Holding you close to me
Oh, what else can it be?
It must be love

[Chorus]
It must be love, it must be love
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreaming of
Oh what a feeling, it must be love

[Outro]
It must be love, it must be love
I fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove[Instrumental]
[Verse 1]
Turn the quiet up, turn the noise down
Let this ol' world just spin around
I wanna feel it swing, wanna feel it sway
And put some feel good in my soul
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke

Want a little more right, and a little less left
Little more right now, a little less what's next
Act like tomorrow's ten years away
And just kick back and let the feelin' flow
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke

[Verse 2]
I set my sails for a new direction
But the wind got in my way
I changed my course
But my definition of change
Just ain't the same

I'm gonna sit right here
Stay away from there
I'm gonna make pretend
I just don't care
And I could get up
Go get her back
Or maybe I'll just let her go
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
(ah come on now)
Go get her back (ohhh)
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Drink a little drink smoke a little, smoke
(You guys put your hands together like this)

[Bridge]
Kick back, gives the blues a spin
Break out the wine, forget again
Dig down deep, find my stash
Light it up, take me back

[Bridge]
Kick back, gives the blues a spin
Break out the wine, forget again
Dig down deep, find my stash
Light it up, memory crash

[Outro]
Oh no, I don’t know
Baby, it might take, all night
Then I’ll maybe break out that old rock and roll
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke

(Lets all stay out here and..)
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
[Instrumental][Verse 1]
Hey girl, what's your name?
It's so loud in here I can't hear a thing
But I sure do like your style
And I can see you came to rock
In your blue jeans and white tank top;
Man that look drives me wild

[Chorus]
And it's hey now here we go
D-j don't you play nothing slow
Keep those girls out on the floor
Gotta make them want to come back for more
Been here since the sun went down
Be here when it comes back around
Worked all week it's time to play
Gonna get a little bit sideways...
Sideways

[Verse 2]
Ain't no need to fight
You all take that redneck stuff outside
That's what parking lots are for
Once you're out you ain't coming back
The man on the ropes ain't got no slack
Man they're busting down the door!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
That's right
Hey now here we go
(hey now here we go)
D-j don't you play nothing slow
Got to make them want to (what?)
Got to make them want to (what?)
Got to make them want to come back for more

[Chorus]
Hey now here we go
D-J don't you play nothing slow
Keep those girls out on the floor
Gotta make them want to come back for more
Been here since the sun went down
Be here when it comes back around
Worked all week it's time to play
Going to get a little bit sideways (na na na na na)
Sideways...sideways...sideways

[Outro]
Hey girl what's your name?
It's so loud in here I can't hear a thingLast night, outta the blue
Driftin' off to the evening news
She said "Honey, what would you do
If you'd never met me"
I just laughed, said "I don't know
But I could take a couple guesses though"
And then tried to dig real deep
Said, "Darling honestly...

I'd do a lot more offshore fishin'
I'd probably eat more drive-thru chicken
Take a few strokes off my golf game
If I'd have never known your name
I'd still be driving that old green 'Nova
I probably never would have heard of yoga
Be a better football fan
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well I'd be looking for a woman like you."

I could tell that got her attention
So I said, "Oh yeah, I forgot to mention
I wouldn't trade a single day
For 100 years the other way."
She just smiled and rolled her eyes,
Cause she's heard all of my lines
I said, "C'mon on girl, seriously
If I hadn't been so lucky

I'd be shootin' pool in my bachelor pad
Playing bass in my cover band
Restocking up cold Bud Light
For poker every Tuesday night
Yeah I'd have a dirtbike in the shed
And not one throw pillow on the bed
I'd keep my cash in a coffee can
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well I'd be looking for a woman like you."

She knows what a mess
I'd be if I didn't have her here
But to be sure
I whispered in her ear

"You know I get sick deep-sea fishin'
And you make the best fried chicken
I got a hopeless golf game
I love the sound of your name
I might miss that old green 'Nova
But I love watchin' you do yoga
I'd take a gold band on my hand
Over being a single man
Cause honestly
I don't know what I'd do
If I'd never met a woman like you."[Verse 1]
We used to pull off Highway 249
Had a cool little place where we'd go and hide on Friday night
And get away from the city lights
We'd find a little wood and build a fire
Somebody'd always bring a couple guitars
And we'd take turns singin' songs and watching it burn
We'd do "Ramblin' Man", "Proud Mary", and "American Band"
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs

[Verse 2]
There was always a line that stuck in your head
That was said in a way you wished you could've said
But you both knew they were singin' it right to you
It felt so good those times you had
That feelin' of wanting somebody so bad
Made you weak in the heart, you couldn't take being apart
Honky Tonk drinkin' songs, we could do 'em all night long
But the ones we remember most

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs

[Bridge]
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs
Always the love songs, always the love songs[Verse 1]
Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign car driving dude with the road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone

[Chorus]
Some beach, somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and a warm breezes a blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere

[Verse 2]
I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of nowhere a Mercedes Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in

[Chorus 2]
Some beach, somewhere
There's nowhere to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot señioritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere

[Verse 3]
I sat in that waiting room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you
You’re not going to feel a thing we'll give you some Novocain
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb

[Chorus 3]
Some beach, somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burning up that atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evening air
On some beach, somewhere
On some beach, somewhere[Verse 1]
Oh hey, boy with your hat back...
Mmm, I kinda like that
If you wanna walk my way
Imma shoot you straight up
Show me what you're made of

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't have time to waste on the boys
That are playing the games
And leaving the girls crying out in the rain
So tell me, baby
Do you got what it takes?

[Chorus]
If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me, love me like you mean it
If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it and make me believe it
If you're gonna love me boy, love me like you mean it

[Verse 2]
Oh hey, I've had my share of losers, liars and users
Looking for a heart to break
So if you're like that
Well take a step back

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't have time to waste on the boys
That are playing the games
And leaving the girls crying out in the rain
So tell me, baby
Are you just crazy or crazy over me?

[Chorus]
If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me, love me like you mean it
If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna  keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it and make me believe it
If you're gonna love me boy, love me like you mean it
If you're gonna love me, love me
If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me, love me, love me
If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it and make me believe it
If you're gonna love me boy, love me like you mean it

[Outro]
Love me like you mean it
Love me like you mean it
If you're gonna love me, love me, love me
Love me like you mean it yeah[Verse 1]
She grew up on the side of the road
Where the church bells ring and strong love grows
She grew up good, she grew up slow
Like American honey

[Verse 2]
Steady as a preacher, free as a weed
Couldn't wait to get goin', but wasn't quite ready to leave
So innocent, pure and sweet
American honey

[Chorus]
There's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days as the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey

[Verse 3]
Get caught in the race of this crazy life
Tryin' to be everything can make you lose your mind
I just wanna go back in time
To American honey, yeah

[Chorus]
There's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days as the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey

[Bridge]
Gone for so long now
I gotta get back to her somehow
To American honey
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, there's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days as the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey

[Outro]
And American honey
Mmm, mmm[Verse 1]
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

[Verse 2]
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go

[Chorus]
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

[Verse 3]
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

[Verse 4]
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

[Chorus]
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

It's just an old beat up truck
Some say that I should trade up
Now that I got some jangle in my pocket
But what they don’t understand
Is it's the miles that make a man
I wouldn’t trade that thing in for a rocket
What they don’t know is my dad and me–
We drove her out to Tennessee
And she’s still here and now he’s gone
So I hold on

[Verse 2]
It's just an old beat up box
Its rusty strings across the top
It probably don’t look like much to you
But these dents and scratches in the wood
Yeah, that’s what makes it sound so good
To me it's better than brand new
You see this here flat top guitar
Has had my back in a million bars
Singing every country song
So I hold on

[Chorus]
To the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah, I hold on, I hold on
Like the stripes to the flag
Like a boy to his dad
I can't change who I am, right or wrong
So I hold on

[Verse 3]
Yeah, baby, looking at you right now
There ain't never been no doubt
Without you I'd be nothing
So if you ever worry about
Me walking out
Yeah, let me tell you something
I hold on
I hold on
Can you hear me, baby?
I hold on
Yeah
I hold on…

[Chorus]
To the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah, I hold on, I hold on
Like the stripes to the flag
Like a boy to his dad
I can't change who I am, right or wrong
So I hold on[Verse 1]
I got a piece of land out in the countryside
Lay back and smell the sun warm up the Georgia pine
Feels so good to be taking it easy
Why would I ever leave? Cause I know

[Chorus]
I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town, where it feels like home
I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Homegrown

[Verse 2]
We got a fire going down by the riverside
Sip whiskey out the bottle, living like we'll never die
Come on and stay a while if you don't believe me
Why would I ever leave, cause I know

[Chorus]
I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town, where it feels like home
I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Homegrown
I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town, where it feels like home
I've got everything I need
Homegrown
And nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Everything I need
Homegrown
And nothing I don't
Homegrown

[Bridge]
It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want
It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want
Weight you carry
It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want
It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want

[Outro]
I've got everything I need, nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Everything I need, nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Everything I need, nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Oh, everything I need and nothing that I don't
Homegrown[Verse 1]
I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down

[Verse 2]
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

[Chorus]
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well

[Chorus]
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well, I'm getting older, too

[Verse 3]
So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, maybe
Well, maybe
Well, maybe
Landslide will bring you down[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease
You're running, you're trying, you're trying to hide
And you're wondering why you can't get free
He's like a curse, he's like a drug
You'll get addicted to his love
You wanna get out, but he's holding you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch

[Chorus]
He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I see that look on your face
You ain't hearing what I say
So I'll say it again, 'cause I been where you been
And I know how it ends, you can't get away-ay-ay
Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothing but lies
And you wanna believe, but you won't be deceived
If you listen to me and take my advice

[Chorus]
He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

[Bridge]
Run, run away
Don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you wanna hear
He'll break your heart, it's just a matter of time
But just remember

[Chorus]
He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

[Outro]
(Oh, oh)
Oh, you better run for your life
(Oh, oh)
Oh, you better run for your life[Verse 1]
She had a shiny little Beamer with the ragtop down
Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barkin' and a-waggin' around
And I just laughed and said "Y'all get in"

[Verse 2]
She had on a new dress and she'd curled her hair
She was lookin' too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do, baby, I don't care
We can go to the show, or we can stay right here

[Chorus]
And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

[Verse 3]
Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancin' and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house

[Chorus]
Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but, baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

[Bridge]
Just let me dust off the seat
Put your pretty little arms around me, hell yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town or baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
We can go to town
Or we can go another round
On my big green tractor[Verse 1]
I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

[Chorus]
Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yes, he did)

[Verse 2]
I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

[Chorus]
Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yeah)

[Verse 3]
Now I'm just rolling home
Into my lover's arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you

[Outro]
That God bless the broken road
That led me straight to you
Oooh[Verse 1]
She said, "I've seen you in here before."
I said, "I've been here a time or two."
She said, "Hello, my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face"
I said, "Girls,"

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

[Verse 2]
I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
"Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand?"
I said, "Dave,"

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
My, how the years have flown
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess those boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

[Bridge]
I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says, "You can't do this boy"
But my pride says, "Oh, yes you can"

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feeling bullet proof
So don't double dog dare me now
Cause I'd have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
May not be good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was[Verse 1]
Well it was friday in the p.m
And just like every weekend
I was ready to throw down
Yeah get a little tore up
So I call my bros up to meet me out on the town
Well wild man willy said I like to really
But idol's on tv
And ray had a date
With his wife and Nate quit drinking
But he didn't tell me

[Chorus]
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all, that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

[Verse 2]
Well I was flying solo down at Silverado's
The joint looking like a morgue
When this country cutie with a rock and roll booty
Came strutting in through the door
Yelled who wants to dance and fired up the band with with a franklin and a shot of patron
She looked right at me and said
"What's it gonna be
Are you gonna let me to party alone?"

[Chorus]
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all, that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

[Chorus]
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all, that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

[Outro]
Come on come on
Get your good time on
Let's have a little fun tonight
Let's have a little fun tonight
Let's have a little fun tonight
Let's have a little fun tonight[Intro]
You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

[Verse 1]
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

[Chorus]
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Verse 2]
It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

[Chorus]
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

[Chorus]
Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love[Verse 1]
Baby, don’t say no so quick
This ain’t about me tryin’ to see how far that I can get
But I ain’t gonna lie, I wouldn’t mind
Just a little bit of you and I
Eye to eye, lips on lips, swayin’ to the music
Real close, we could we both use a little
A let go kinda night
Baby, if you want a

[Chorus: Billy Currington]
Good time we can get on it
Take a shot or you can sip on it
Find a floor and we can dance on it, slow song it
Far as I can tell that finger ain’t got no ring on it
Come on baby, bring on it
It’s one of those stars fallin’, love callin’
Get ya feelin’ all right nights
Sounds good, don’t it, don’t it
Every little thing you got, you know that I want it, want it
Sounds pretty dang good now don’t it

Well, I just now seen that smile
And I bet it’s been a minute since you tapped on into
Your wild and crazy side
So baby, let’s do this
Tonight, baby that moon looks
Just right, don’t fight it, if you want a

[Chorus: Billy Currington]
Good time we can get on it

So baby, let’s get on it
You’re gonna love it, you can bet on it
Karaoke, we can microphone it
Whatever you want it

[Chorus: Billy Currington]
Good time we can get on it
Take a shot or you can sip on it

Far as I can tell that finger ain’t got no ring on it

I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush, ain’t slowin’ down
I got it real bad, want everything she has
That smile and the midnight laugh she’s givin’ you now

[Chorus]
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then, you’d want me just as much
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush

[Verse 2]
I don’t get no sleep, I don’t get no peace
Thinkin’ about her under your bed sheets
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s pullin’ you in
Lord knows I’ve tried, I can’t get her off my mind

[Chorus]
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then, you’d want me just as much
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush

I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush, it ain’t slowin’ down[Verse 1]
Well here you come again and you're looking so fine
You don't notice me but it's alright
I'm just a guy who wishes that I could be your man someday
Yeah a picture paints a thousand words, it's true
But it's still not enough for how I feel about you
I want to put you in a melody, I got to set you into a groove

[Chorus 1]
I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I love this girl oh
If I could press play, repeat how happy I'd be
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me
You'd be right where you belong
I want to put you in a song, oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
Well I'd sing about your smile and your pretty blue eyes
The way your hair shimmers in the sunlight
It'd be so easy, I'd just write it from my heart
Because I got to tell the world what you mean to me
Wrap you up in a melody so you'll be
Stuck in my head all day
Because you're already there anyway, yes you are

[Chorus 2]
I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I love this girl
If I could press play, repeat how happy I'd be
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me
You'd be right where you belong
I want to put you in a song

[Bridge]
And if I get it right everybody will be singing along yeah
And when they see you on the street they'll say
Hey aren't you the girl in that song

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 3]
I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I'm in love with this girl
Yeah if I could press play, rewind a couple million times
Imagine for a moment that you're all mine
Every night I'd drive you home
If I could put you in a
Let me put you in a song
Let me put you in a song
Oh a pretty little song about you baby

[Guitar Solo 2 to Fade][Verse 1]
She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', "no way she ain't got one"
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "come here, boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Verse 2]
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

[Chorus 2]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is"
She was like, "come here boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Bridge]
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

[Chorus 3]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "come here boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Outro]
Yeah play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody play it again, play it again, play it again[Verse 1]
Them jeans are faded
In all the right places
You got me hanging on tight to your curves like little E races
Girl your funky little back beat has got me
Feel like I’m tipsy
And I ain’t even had a drink

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right
Just like everything you’re doing to me right now's
Making me crazy
I wanna kiss you on the dance floor
Kiss you like a lets go, come on
Baby let me hear you say oh, oh
I wanna kiss you with the neon lights in your eyes glowing
Then I wanna kiss you in the morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning

[Verse 2]
Oh you little outlaw
Stealing my heart and all
When you drop it down low
Touch your toes girl
You know you just show it off
That little tattoo on your tan line, oh my
Pretty little butterfly
What else have you got to hide?

[Chorus] x2
I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right
Just like everything you’re doing to me right now's
Making me crazy
I wanna kiss you on the dance floor
Kiss you like a lets go, come on
Baby let me hear you say oh, oh
I wanna kiss you with the neon lights in your eyes glowing
Then I wanna kiss you in the morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning, morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning[Verse 1: Reba McEntire]
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

[Chorus: Reba McEntire & Kelly Clarkson]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

[Chorus: Reba McEntire & Kelly Clarkson]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

[Verse 3: Reba McEntire & (Kelly Clarkson)]
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(I watched you die in your sleep)
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
(I was too young for you to lean on me)
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
(You never saw me)
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

[Chorus: Reba McEntire & Kelly Clarkson]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

[Outro: Reba McEntire]
Because of you
Because of you[Verse 1]
I spent 20 years trying to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
I been there, done that and I ain't looking back on the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home

[Chorus]
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright

[Verse 2]
I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I lived a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home

[Chorus]
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright

[Verse 3]
I been there, done that and I ain't looking back
It's been a long long road
Feels like I never left, that's how the story goes
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles aways or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home

[Chorus]
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go home[Verse 1]
He works way too much for way too little
He drinks way too early till way too late
He hasn't had a raise since New Year's Day
In eighty-eight gets trampled on by everyone
Except when he comes in here

And he's the product of the Haggard generation
He's got a redneck side when you get him agitated
He got the gold toothed look from a stiff right hook
He's proud he took for his right wing stand on Vietnam
Says he lost his brother there

He yells out Johnny Cash
And the band starts to play
A ring of fire as he walks up
And stands there by the stage
And he says

[Chorus]
Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
Life was good and love was easy

[Verse 2]
She's got an MBA and a plush corner office
She's got a don't mess with me attitude
She'll close a deal she don't reveal that she can feel
The loneliness the emptiness
Except when she comes in here

She's the product of the Me generation
She's got a rock and roll side when you get her agitated
She got the tattoo there on her derriere from a spring break dare
In Panama where love was all she thought she'd ever need

She yells out to the band
Know any Bruce Springsteen
Then she jumps up on the bar
And she, and she starts to scream
She says

[Chorus]
Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good and love was easy

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Can or can't you get my mind off thinkin' 'bout
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Hey, hell yeah

[Chorus]
Hell yeah
Turn it up
Right on
Hell yeah
Sounds good
Sing that song
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good

[Chorus]
Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good and love was easy[Intro]
Weather man said, it’s gonna snow
By now I should, be used to the cold

[Verse 1]
Mid-February shouldn’t be so scary
It was only December
I still remember the presents, the tree, you and me

[Chorus]
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you

[Bridge]
Living alone, here in this place
I think of you, and I’m not afraid

[Verse 2]
Your favorite records make me feel better
Cause you sing along
With every song
I know you didn’t mean to give them to me

[Chorus]
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you

[Break]
It really sinks in, you know, when I see it in stone

[Chorus]
Cause you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you[Verse 1]
She said, "I'm going out with my girlfriends
Margaritas at the Holiday Inn"
Oh, have mercy, my only thought
Was tequila makes her clothes fall off

[Verse 2]
I told her put an extra layer on
I know what happens when she drinks Patrón
Her closet's missing half the things she bought
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off

[Chorus]
She'll start by kicking out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink

[Verse 3]
Them pantyhose ain't gonna last too long
If the DJ puts Bon Jovi on
She might come home in a tablecloth
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off
Whoa

[Verse 4]
She can handle any champagne brunch
A bridal shower with Bacardi punch
Jello shooters full of Smirnoff
But tequila makes her clothes fall off

[Chorus]
She'll start by kicking out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink

[Outro]
She don't mean nothing
She's just having fun
Tomorrow she'll say, "Oh, what have I done?"
Her friends will joke about the stuff she lost
Yeah, Tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh, Tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh, Tequila makes her clothes fall off[Verse 1]
Hey girl, I’m just a small town run around
I get my kicks out on the outskirts of town
I could never do it like a pretty city boy
I’m more a fishin’ in the dark nitty gritty boy
So lay back and let me paint you a picture
The way I wanna kiss you is

[Chorus]
Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love, wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night ‘til the sun comes back
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that

[Verse 2]
When I’m with you I can see down the road girl
Not just the gravel one we’re travelin’ on girl
And I’m bettin’ that it’s gonna be a wild ride
But I promise that I’m gonna be there by your side
I think we got another memory in the makin’
So baby let’s take it, take it

[Chorus]
Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love, wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night ‘til the sun comes back
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that

[Bridge]
I ain’t gonna do it like a pretty city boy
I’m a fishin’ in the dark nitty gritty boy
So let me love you

[Chorus]
Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love, wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night ‘til the sun comes back
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that

[Outro]
Baby, I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that[Verse 1]
I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Verse 2]
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Verse 3]
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane

[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Outro]
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
It ain’t in a high rise looking for a good time shutting down the city lights
It ain’t in the water floating like a bobber soaking up that hot sunshine
As good as it gets, no that ain’t where it is

[Chorus]
It’s at 2 A.M. when she's reaching over
Faded T-shirt hanging off her shoulder
Dressed up, hair down, in a ball cap
Yep Yep, as long as I get that
Sweet little something late night kiss
On a plane or a train or way back in the sticks
I swear, if she's there, that’s where
Yep yep, that's where it's at

[Verse 2]
It ain’t in a suped-up shiny red new truck, if she ain’t to my right
It ain’t in a dive bar, tall can of PBR, poppin' tops rockin' all night
As good as it gets, no, that ain’t where it is

[Chorus]
It’s at 2 A.M. when she's reaching over
Faded T-shirt hanging off her shoulder
Dressed up, hair down, in a ball cap
Yep Yep, as long as I get that
Sweet little something late night kiss
On a plane or a train or way back in the sticks
I swear, if she's there, that’s where
Yep yep, that's where it's at

[Bridge]
No, it don’t matter wherever we’re at (no)
No, it don’t get no better than that
It ain’t in a suped-up shiny red new truck, if she ain’t to my right

[Chorus]
It’s at 2 A.M. when she's reaching over
Faded T-shirt hanging off her shoulder
Dressed up, hair down, in a ball cap
Yep Yep, as long as I get that
Sweet little something late night kiss
On a plane or a train or way back in the sticks
I swear, if she's there, that’s where
Yep yep, that's where it's at

[Outro]
Yeah, that’s where it’s at
Yep, yep, (that’s where it’s at)
2 A.M. when she’s reaching’ over
Faded t-shirt hanging off her shoulder (that’s where it’s at)[Verse 1]
It's hard to find the perfect time to say something
You know is gonna change everything
Living with the shame, it ain't nothing like the pain that I saw on her face
Now me and my pile of things
That she throw out the window
Drowning next to me
No seven years of good can't hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring

[Chorus]
So let it rain, let it pour, cause she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve
Let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain

[Verse 2]
Last thing I remember was the unfamiliar taste of someone on my lips
It's too late to turn around
When the shades start coming down
The guilt you feel is the last thing on your mind

[Chorus]
So let it rain, let it pour, cause she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain

So let it rain, let it pour, cause she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve, just let it come down on me
Let it come down on me, let it rain
Ooh let it rain, ooh let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain, ooh let it rain[Produced by Shane McAnally]

[Verse 1]
Hey girl, wassup
I know it's late but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz, but
That song came on and I just thought
What harm could come from one little call
I know you say you're taken but I say
Girl you're takin' too long

[Chorus]
To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him

[Verse 2]
I know you don't wanna break his heart
But that ain't no good reason to be
Keeping us apart
Look, just tell him it's you, it ain't him
And maybe you can lie to him and say you'll
Still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him
That you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I
Kinda fit like a glove

[Chorus]
So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
It ain't my business to be all up in
But I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
I know that you so done with him
Break up with him, break up with him

[Verse 3]
You would've hung up by now
If you weren't thinking it too
No pressure whatever
Just do what you gotta do
But if I was you

[Chorus]
I'd tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Just rip it off just like a Band-Aid
Yeah, I know I said it but I'll say it again
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
The way you look at me girl you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
Just break up with him[Verse 1]
He was sittin' there, his brush in hand
Painting waves as they danced, upon the sand
With every stroke, he brought to life
The deep blue of the ocean, against the mornin' sky
I asked him if he only painted ocean scenes
He said for twenty dollars, I'll paint you anything

[Chorus]
Could you paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while she'll be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

[Verse 2]
He looked at me, with knowing eyes
Then took a canvas from a bag there by his side
Picked up a brush, and said to me
Son, just where in this picture would you like to be
I said if there's any way you can
Could you paint me back into her arms again

[Chorus]
Could you paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while she'll be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

[Chorus]
Paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while she'll be, mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

[Outro]
Oh, paint me a Birmingham[Verse 1]
Don't you dare go runnin' down my little town where I grew up
And I won't cuss your city lights
If you ain't ever took a ride around and cruised right through the heart of my town
Anything you say would be a lie

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We may live our lives a little slower
But that don't mean I wouldn't be proud to show ya

[Chorus 1]
Where I come from
There's an old plow boy out turnin' up dirt
Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple of boys fight in the parkin' lot
No, nobody's gonna call the cops
Where I come from

[Verse 2]
See that door right there, man, I swear that it ain't never been locked
And I guarantee that it never will
That old man right there in the rockin' chair at the courthouse square, I'll tell you now
He could buy your fancy car with hundred dollar bills

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't let those faded overalls fool ya
He made his millions without one day of schoolin'

[Chorus 2]
Where I come from
There's a pickup truck with the tailgate down
Where I come from
The pine trees are singin' a song of the south
Where I come from
That little white church is gonna have a crowd
And yeah, I'm pretty damn proud
Of where I come from

[Bridge]
Where I come from
There's a big ol' moon shinin' down at night
Where I come from
There's a man done wrong, gonna make it right

[Chorus 1]
Where I come from
There's an old plow boy out turnin' up dirt
Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple of boys fight in the parkin' lot
No, ain't nobody gonna call the cops

[Outro]
Yeah, that river runs across that old flint rock
Where I come from
Where I come from[Verse 1]
I woke up again this morning
And wouldn't you know it... pouring rain
I went and burned a pot of coffee
And like us I poured it down the drain

[Chorus]
Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back song

[Verse 2]
I know I said I wouldn't miss you
But now I'm saying I'm a fool
You're on the feel good side of leaving
And I'm the backside of a mule

[Verse 3]
And I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my so sad come back song

[Verse 4]
And now I'm laying down without you
In this king size empty bed
And I wish I had my arms around you
But I'll just dream of you instead

[Chorus]
Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back song

[Verse 5]
Hey, I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go and letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back song

[Bridge]
Oh yeah yeah

I know I said I wouldn't miss you
I said I wouldn't miss you girl, yeah


[Outro]
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

We all sang na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na, yeah

Come on now

This is my my bad, come back song[Verse 1]
Girl you've never known no one like me
Up there in your high society
They might tell you I'm no good
Girl they need to understand
Just who I am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

[Verse 2]
I may drink too much and play too loud
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd
That don't mean I don't respect
My Mama or my Uncle Sam
Yes sir, yes ma'am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

[Verse 3]
I might have a reckless streak
At least a country-mile wide
If you're gonna run with me
It's gonna be a wild ride
When it comes to loving you
I've got velvet hands
I'll show you how a real bad boy
Can be a real good man

[Verse 4]
I take all the good times I can get
I'm too young for growing up just yet
Ain't much I can promise you
'Sept to do the best I can
I'll be damned
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

[Outro]
I may be a real bad boy
Oh but baby I'm a real good man
Yes I am[Verse 1]
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from bein' too far gone

[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Verse 2]
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothin' like your love to get me high

[Chorus]
And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Outro]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey

[Verse 1]
I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Working spitting hunting and fishing
Stone cold country by the grace of God
I was gasing up the other day
And an ol' boy pulled up with a license plate
From Ohio I thought oh good lord he's lost
From his wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile

[Chorus 1]
Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

[Chorus 2]
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

[Verse 2]
It ain't where
It's how you live
We weren't raised to take
We were raised to give
The shirt off our back
To anyone in need
We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day
Before we fall asleep
Cause in God we trust and we believe
And we see what's wrong
And we know what's right
And all Hank he said it all
When he said country folks can survive

[Chorus 1]
Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

[Chorus 2]
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

[Chorus 1]
Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

[Chorus 2]
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

[Outro]
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide[Intro]
Hey girl, go on now
You know you've got everybody looking

[Verse 1]
Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the toolbox, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate, girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, aww

[Chorus]
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

[Verse 2]
Somebody's sweet little farmer's child
With a gattle in her Bud to get a little wild
Pony tail and a pretty smile
Rope me in from a country mile
So come on over here and get in my arms
Spin me around this big ole barn
Tangle me up like grandma's yarn, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, aww

[Chorus]
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

[Guitar Break]

[Bridge]
Now dance like a dandelion
In the wind on the hill underneath the pines, yea
Move like the river flows
Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes
All I wanna do is get to holdin' you and get to knowin' you
And get to showin' you and get to lovin' you 'fore the night is through
Baby, you know what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, aww

[Chorus]
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me[Verse 1]
When I look in her eyes, it ain't no surprise
Sparks start a flying like the 4th of July
She gets me so hot, my heart starts a popping'
When we get to kissing, there ain't no stopping
When it comes to love, she ain't no slacker
My little darlin' is a firecracker

[Verse 2]
When I light the fuse, I gotta get back quick
You gotta be careful with a dynamite stick
Son of a gun, she's fun to handle
And she packs a punch like a roman candle
She's a pack of black cats in a red paper wrapper
My little darlin' is a Firecracker

[Chorus]
We might not ought to take a roll in the hay
Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
We're a match made in heaven and it ain't no joke
But I'd sure hate to see it go up in smoke
We got a good thing going and it feels so right
She's a firecracker, she's the light of my life

[Verse 3]
She goes off with a great big bang
Boys, I tell yea it's a beautiful thing
She takes off, you better hang on tight
She's a blonde bottle rocket in the middle of the night
When she makes love she's a heartattacker
My little darlin' is a Firecracker

[Chorus ]
We might not ought to take a roll in the hay
Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
We're a match made in heaven and it ain't no joke
But I'd sure hate to see it go up in smoke
We got a good thing going and it feels so right
She's a firecracker, she's the light of my life

Yea, we gotta good thing going and it feels so right
She's a Firecracker
She's the light of my life

We gotta good thing going and it feels so right
She's a Firecracker
She's the light of my life


[Outro]Hang up that red dress
Let down your hair
Cancel those reservations
Don't need to go no where
As good as your looking right now
Girl bet your thinkin I'm crazy
There's a side of you that I wanna see
That never ceases to amaze me

Gimme that girl with the hair in a mess
Sleepy little smile with her head on my chest
Thats the you that I like best
Gimme that girl
Gimme that girl lovin up on me
Old t-shirt and a pair of jeans
Thats the you I wanna see
Gimme that girl, gimme that girl

Gimme the girl thats beautiful
Without a trace of makeup of on
Barefoot in the kitchen
Singing her favorite song
Dancing around like a fool
Starring in her own little show
Gimme the girl the rest of the world
Ain't lucky enough to know

Gimme that girl with the hair in a mess
Sleepy little smile with her head on my chest
Thats the you that I like best
Gimme that girl
Gimme that girl lovin up on me
Old t-shirt and a pair of jeans
Thats the you I wanna see
Gimme that girl, gimme that girl
[repeat][Verse 1]
I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars
Oh, it sounds good to me, I said

[Chorus]
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you, closer to you

[Verse 2]
I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile
Oh, it sounds good to me
Yes, it sounds so good to me

[Chorus]
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you, closer to you

[Verse 3]
I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
Oh, it sounds so good to me

[Chorus]
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you, closer to you
Closer to you
Cowboy take me away
Closer to you[Verse 1]
Girl, I been thinking 'bout us
And you know I ain't good at this stuff
These feelings piling up won't give me no rest
This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways, yeah maybe
I don't know how long it'll take me but I'll do my best

[Chorus 1]
You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

[Verse 2]
Yeah, that came out a little country
But every word was right on the money
And I got you smiling honey right back at me
Now hold on cause I aren’t done
There's more where that came from
Well you know I'm just having fun, but seriously

[Chorus 2]
If you'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You'll be my Little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You'll be my sugar, baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

[Bridge]
Your kiss just said it all
I'm glad we had this talk
Nothing left to do but fall in each other’s arms
I could have said "I love you"
Could have wrote you a line or two
Baby, all I know to do is speak right from the heart

[Chorus 1]
You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

[Chorus 2]
If you'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You'll be my Little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You'll be my sugar, baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

[Outro]
I'll be your honey bee[Verse 1]
Plowing these fields in the hot summer sun
Over by the gate lordy here she comes
With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea
I make a little room and she climbs on up
Open up a throttle and stir a little dust
Just look at her face she ain’t a fooling me

[Chorus]
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always staring at me
While I'm chugging along
She likes the way it's pulling while we're tilling up the land
She's even kind of crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy

[Verse 2]
We ride back and forth 'til we run out of light
Take it to the barn put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft sit and talk with the radio on
She said she's got a dream and I asked what it is
She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
One more teeny weenie ride before take her home

[Chorus]
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always staring at me
While I'm chugging along
She likes the way it's pulling while we're tilling up the land
She's even kind of crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy

[Bridge]
Well, she isn’t into cars or pickup trucks
But if it runs like a Deere, man, her eyes light up

[Chorus]
She thinks my tractor's
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always staring at me
While I'm chugging along
She likes the way it's pulling while we're tilling up the land
She's even kind of crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy
She thinks my tractor's sexy
She thinks my tractor's sexy[Verse 1]
I was raised off of Rural Route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walked to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to the Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road

[Chorus]
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

[Verse 2]
Her daddy didn't like me much
With my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road

[Chorus]
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

[Bridge]
I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh, I got her back again
And driving home tonight
Feels like I've found a long lost friend

[Chorus]
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road
Yes, I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road[Verse 1]
Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun
Slipped away
But I won’t cry, 'cause I know I’ll never be lonely
For you are the stars to me
You are the light I follow

[Chorus]
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

[Verse 2]
I can hear those echoes in the wind at night
Calling me back in time
Back to you
In a place far away where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile
You are my tomorrow

[Chorus]
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

[Bridge]
Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking
But I stay strong and I hold on 'cause I know
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

[Outro]
'Til I see you again
'Til I see you again
Yeah, yeah, oh
Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone[Verse 1]
I worked all week
Cleaned up clean cut and clean shaved
I got the cover off the '68
I fire it up and let them horses sing
A little pretty thing
A little tan-legged Georgia dream
She’s a rocking them holey jeans
Baby what you got going on Saturday?
You know words got it there’s gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile
Four wheel drives and big mud tires
Muscadine wine

[Chorus]
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party

[Verse 2]
If you wanna drink
Go baby just do your thing
Give up your keys
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while we’ll sneak away from the bonfire
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside
Gotcha sipping on some moonshine
Baby if you're in the mood you can settle for a one night rodeo
You can be my tan-legged Juliet
I’ll be your Redneck Romeo

[Chorus]
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party

[Outro]
Y'all ready for this?
Y'all gonna turn it on up[Verse 1]
She left without leaving a number
Said, she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
Cuz she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

[Chorus]
If you're calling 'bout the car, I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got something to sell
You're wasting your time, I'm not buying
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Verse 2]
The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

[Chorus]
If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Bridge]
Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

[Chorus]
If you're calling 'bout my heart, it's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way, boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell, this is Austin
And I still love you
I still love you[Verse 1]
I remember trying not to stare
The night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later
In the front porch light
Taking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet
I thought I loved you then

[Chorus]
Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

[Verse 2]
I remember taking you back
To right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There were people around
But I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again
I thought I loved you then

[Chorus]
Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

[Verse 3]
I can just see you
With a baby on the way
I can just see you
When your hair is turning grey
What I can't see
Is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I've said that before

[Chorus 2]
And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
We'll look back someday
At this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say
And I thought I loved you then
And I thought I loved you then

[Outro]
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo oooI'm the son of a third generation farmer
I've been married ten years to the farmer's daughter
I'm a God fearin', hardworkin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road with my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' five miles an hour
On my international harvester

Three miles of cars layin' on their horns
Fallin' on deaf ears of corn
Lined up behind me like a big parade
Of late to work road raged jerks
Shoutin' obscene words
Flippin' me the bird

Well you may be on a state paved road
But that blacktop runs through my payload
Excuse me for tryin' to do my job
But this year ain't been no bumper crop

If you don't like the way I'm a drivin'
Get back on the interstate
Otherwise, sit tight and be nice
And quit your honkin' at me that way

I'm the son of a third generation farmer
I've been married ten years to the farmer's daughter
I've got two boys in the county 4-H
I'm a lifetime sponsor of the F.F.A

Hey!
That's a what I make
I make a lot of hay for a little pay
But I'm proud to say

I'm a God fearin', hardworkin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road with my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' five miles an hour
On my international harvester

Well I know you got your own deadlines
But cussin' at me won't save you no time, hoss
This big-wheeled wide load ain't goin' any faster
So just smile and wave and tip your hat
To the man up on the tractor

Cause I'm the son of a third generation farmer
I've been married ten years to the farmer's daughter
I've got two boys in the county 4-H
I'm a lifetime sponsor of the F.F.A

Hey!
That's a what I make
I make a lot of hay for a little pay
But I'm proud to say

I'm a God fearin', hardworkin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road with my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' five miles an hour
On my international harvester

I'm a God fearin', hardworkin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road with my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' five miles an hour
On my international harvester[Verse 1]
I left out in a cloud of taillights and dust
Swore I was not coming back
Said I'd enough
Saw you in the rear view standing
Fading from my life
But I wasn't turning round
No, not this time

[Chorus]
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been, should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it

[Verse 2]
When we make choices we got to live with them
Heard you found a real good man, and you married him
I wonder if sometimes I cross your mind
Where would we be today?
If I never drove that car away

[Chorus]
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been, should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't think about it

[Chorus]
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been, should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it

[Outro]
No no
Don't think I don't
Don't think I don't
Mmm

I'll tell you something, 1968 was just another year, the fields needed tilling and there wasn't enough rain. But it was the first year Rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day

[Verse 1]
You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlight, dance with your boots in it (Dirt)
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (Dirt)
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...

[Chorus]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Music Video Interlude 1]
Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay

[Verse 2]
You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it (Dirt)
You know you came from it (Dirt)
And some day you'll return to...

[Chorus ]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Music Video Interlude 2]
I asked Rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world, and no she said "the world comes right to my window every day"... Even if it's broken
(You know you came from it (dirt, dirt) And some day you'll return to)

[Chorus]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains, you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Post-Chorus]
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Music Video Interlude 3]
See Rosie was right about two things: you don't have to see the world to be worldly, just raise good children, bake good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window. She's right about something else too, I built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen

[Outro]
(You know you came from it
And some day, you'll return to it)[Intro]
You boys ever met a real country girl
Talkin', true blue, out in the woods, down home, country girl

[Verse 1]
She's a hot little number in her pickup truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party all nighter from South Carolina
A bad mamajama from down in Alabama
She's a ragin' cajun, a lunatic from Brunswick
Juicy Georgia peach with a thick southern drawl
Sexy swing and walk, brother, she's all

[Chorus]
Country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay
Country
Brother, she's country

[Verse 2]
A hell raisin' sugar when the sun goes down
Mama taught her how to rip up the town
Honey drippin' honey from the holler in Kentucky
Get you flippin', kinda trippy like a Mississippi hippie
She's a Kansas princess
Crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk
Brother, she's all

[Chorus]
Country, (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay
Country
Nothin' but country

[Bridge]
(Thick southern drawl)
(Sexy swing and walk)
(Aw, show 'em how a country girl does it one time now)

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Brother, she's country
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
Nothin' but country
Yeah, yeah-ah
She's country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain't afraid to stay
Country
Yeah, she's nothin' but country

[Outro]
She's all about the country
From the backwoods, she's a homegrown, down to the bone
She's country[Verse 1]
There's a story that my daddy tells religiously
Like clockwork every time he see's an opening
In a conversation, 'bout the way things used to be
I just roll my eyes and make a B-line for the door
I'd always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor
Hanging onto every word
Man, the things I heard
It was harder times and longer days
Five miles to school uphill both ways
We were cane switched raised and dirt floor poor
Course that was back before the war
Yea your uncle and I made quite a pair
Flying F-15's through hostile air
He went down but they missed me by a hair
He'd always stop right there and say

[Chorus]
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of

[Verse 2]
Son graduating college, that was momma's dream
And I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned Eighteen
Cause when you got a fast car, and think you got everything
I learned real quick those GTO's don't run off faith
I ended up broke down in some town north of L.A
Working maximum hours, for minimum wage
I fell in love next thing I know
Babies came and the car got sold
Sure do miss that old Hot Rod
But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs
Dad I wonder if I ever let you down
If you're ashamed how I turned out
Well he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow
Said let me tell you right now

[Chorus]
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
No need to make a million just be thankful to be working
If you're doing what you're able
Putting food there on the table
And providing for the family that you love
That's something to be proud of

[Pre-Chorus]
And if all you ever really do is the best you can...
Well, you did it man

[Chorus]
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
Now that's something to be proud of

[Verse 1]
I’ll never settle down
That’s what I always thought
Yeah, I was that kind of man
Just ask anyone

[Chorus]
I don’t dance, But here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It Ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand
Cause, I don’t dance

[Verse 2]
Love’s never come my way
I’ve never been this far
Cause you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart

[Chorus]
No, I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don’t dance
Ohhh
I don’t dance

Ooh

I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere

I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yeah, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don’t dance

Oh
No..

Oooh…

[Intro]
Well, it's a long way from Star, Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight

[Verse 1]
And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been

[Chorus]
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

[Verse 2]
Well, I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasing dreams, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

[Outro]
Mississippi girl
Oh
Mississippi girl
Mississippi girl
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Mississippi girl[Verse 1]
You've been singing, that same old song
Far too long, far too long
Say you'll buy me a shiny ring
But your words don't mean a thing
No more calling me baby
No more loving like crazy

[Chorus]
Till you take me down (take me down)
You better take me down (take me down)
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down (take me down)
Take me down (take me down)
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down

[Verse 2]
You can't ride this gravy train
Anymore, anyway
There's a price for keeping me
I might be cheap, but I ain't free
No more calling me baby
No more loving like crazy

[Repeat Chorus 1x]
Come on!

[Verse 3]
Charming devil, silver tongue
Had your fun, now you're done
Mama warned me 'bout your games
She don't like you anyways

No more calling me baby
No more loving like crazy
No more chicken and gravy
Ain't gonna have your baby!

[Repeat Chorus 1x]

Take me down to the little white church, take me down
Take me down, take me down to the little white church
Take me down, take me down, take me down, take me down to the little white church
Take me down to the little white church, take me down to the little white church[Intro]
No country music was harmed in the making of this song
This is only a test-t-t

[Verse 1]
Well, I wish I had some shoes on my two bare feet
And it's getting kinda cold in these painted on cut-off jeans
I hate the way this bikini top chafes
Do I really have to wear it all day? (Yeah, baby)

[Verse 2]
I hear you over there on your tailgate whistlin' [whistle]
Sayin', "Hey, girl" (Hey, girl)
But you know I ain't listenin'
'Cause I got a name
And to you, it ain't "Pretty little thing"
"Hottie" or "Baby"
It's driving me red-red-red-red-red-red-redneck crazy

[Chorus]
Being the girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouths shut, and ride along
And be the girl in a country song

[Verse 2]
Well, shakin' my moneymaker ain't never made me a dime
And there ain't no sugar for you in this shaker of mine
Tell me one more time "You gotta get you some of that"
Sure, I'll slide on over, but you're gonna get slapped (Ha)
These days, it ain't easy bein' that

[Chorus]
Girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouths shut, and ride along
And be the girl in a country song

[Bridge]
(Yep, yep, yeah, baby)
Aw, naw, Conway and George Strait
Never did it this way
Back in the old days
Aw, y'all, we ain't a cliché
That ain't no way to treat a lady

[Chorus]
Like a girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for
Is looking good for you and your friends on the weekend
Nothin' more (Woo)
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut, and ride along
Down some old dirt road we don't even wanna be on
And be the girl in a country song (Yeah, baby)

[Outro]
I ain't your tan-legged Juliet!
Can I put on some real clothes now?
Aw, naw (Haha)[Verse 1]
She rolled in
My little sandy town
She spent the summer there
A couple houses down
Well it was magic in the air
When she caught my eye
We shared three short months
And one long goodbye

[Chorus]
She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah, the one that got away

[Verse 2]
Well she kissed my lips
Down on Ocean Drive
She set my world on fire
On the fourth of July
We wrote our names in the sand
Under the star-soaked sky
But it washed away like she did
With the rising tide

[Chorus]
She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah, the one that got away

[Bridge]
Every summer that rolls around
I'm looking over my shoulder
Wishing I could see her face
Wishing I could hold her

[Chorus]
She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah, the one that got away

[Outro]
Yeah, she was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
She was the one that got away
She rolled in
My little sandy town
She spent the summer there
A couple houses down[Intro]
Turn it up some
Alright boys, this is her favorite song
You know that right
So, if we play it good and loud
She might get up and dance again
Ohh, she put her beer down
Here she comes
Here she comes
Left, left, left right left
Whoo

[Verse 1]
Hustlers shootin' eight ball
Throwin' darts at the wall
Feelin' damn near ten feet tall
Here she comes, Lord help us all
Ol' T.W.'s girlfriend done slapped him out his chair
Poor ole boy, it ain't his fault
It's so hard not to stare

[Chorus]
At that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm, make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk
(Aww son)

[Verse 2]
Now Honey, you can't blame her
For what her mama gave her
It ain't right to hate her
For workin' that money-maker
Band shuts down at two
But we're hangin' out till three
We hate to see her go
But love to watch her leave

[Chorus]
With that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm
Make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
With that honky tonk badonkadonk
(Ooh, that's what I'm talkin' bout right there, honey)

[Bridge]
We don't care about the drinkin'
Barely listen to the band
Our hands, they start a shakin'
When she gets the urge to dance
Drivin' everybody crazy
You think you fell in love
Boys, you better keep your distance
You can look but you can't touch

[Chorus]
That honkey tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm
Make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk

[Outro]
That honky tonk badonkadonk
Yeah, that honky tonk badonkadonk
(That honky tonk badonkadonk)
That's it, right there boys, that's why we do what we do
It ain't for the money, it ain't for the glory, it ain't for the free whiskey
(That honky tonk badonkadonk)
It's for the badonkadonk
(That honky tonk badonkadonk)[Verse 1]
Last night, I got served a little bit too much of that poison, baby
Last night, I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night, I met a guy on the dance floor
And I let him call me baby

[Chorus 1]
And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
Woo!

[Verse 2]
We left the club, right around three o'clock in the morning
His Pinto, sitting there, in the parking lot
When it should've been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?

[Chorus 1]
And I don't even know his last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
Here we go!

[Bridge]
Today, I woke up thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
I gotta go
I take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here, stays here, all of this will disappear
There's just one little problem

[Chorus 2]
I don't even know my last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no! What have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name

[Breakdown]
What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?
Oh, what have I done?
I don't even know my last name
Well, it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Hey, yeah, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, oh

[Outro]
It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Oh, yeah[Verse 1]
Preacher said he died too young
Over there toting that gun
For Uncle Sam and our freedom
Mom and Daddy dressed in black
They folded up that flag
Handed it to dad
And started praying
Yeah he went out 21 guns blazing

[Chorus]
And that's One Hell of an Amen
That's the only way to go
Fighting the good fight
Till the good Lord calls you home
And so be well, my friend
Until I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a Hell of an Amen

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Doctor said he ain't got long
He just smiled said bring it on
If you think I'm scared
You got it all wrong
A little cancer can't break me
My heart's right and I believe
We all hit our knees
Started praying
No, he never gave up
Said the Good Lord's waiting

[Chorus]
And that's One Hell of an Amen
That's the only way to go
Fighting the good fight
Till the good Lord calls you home
And so be well, my friend
Until I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a Hell of an Amen

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
So be well my friend
Til' I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a Hell of an Amen

Amen

It's a Hell of an Amen[Verse 1]
She likes it when I call in sick to work
Spend the whole day hanging with her
I might get fired but that's alright
I'm doing what she likes
She likes it when I bring home fresh fajitas
And mix up a pitcher of margaritas
Catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night
Doing what she likes

[Chorus]
She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

[Verse 2]
She likes it when I get past second gear
Sees gravel flying in the rear view mirror
Sometimes I'm pushing 95
Doing what she likes
And she likes it when I find a road that's dark
Can we pull up somewhere and park?
Turn the radio on and turn off the lights
Keep doing what she likes

[Chorus]
She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

[Bridge]
She likes it when I sing her old silly songs
And throwing words where they don't belong
Sometimes we laugh 'til we almost cry
Doing what she likes
Doing what she likes

[Chorus]
She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

[Outro]
Yeah, I like doing what she likes
Hmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
I saw you standing in the middle of the thunder and lightning
I know you're feeling like you just can't win, but you're trying
It's hard to keep on keeping on when you're being pushed around
Don't even know which way is up
You just keep spinnin' down, 'round down

[Chorus]
Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

[Verse 2]
So hold your head up and tell yourself
That there's something more
And walk out that door
Go find a new rose
Don't be afraid of the thorns
'Cause we all have thorns
Just put your feet up to the edge
Put your face in the wind
And when you fall back down
Keep on rememberin'

[Chorus]
Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

[Bridge]
It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna run out of sting
It's gonna leave you alone
It's gonna set you free, set you free

[Chorus]
Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

[Outro]
It's gonna set you free
It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna set you free[Verse: 1]
Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when

[Verse: 2]
Remember when we vowed the vows
And walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt
Remember when

[Verse: 3]
Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when

[Verse: 4]
Remember when the sound of little feet
Was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Remember when

[Verse: 5]
Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookn' back it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are
Where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
Remember when
Remember when we said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when

[Intro]
Oh, you like the way that sounds?

[Verse 1]
Little Jimmy Jackson is jackinl up his Bronco
He's gonna lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull
And all the girls are gettin' pretty, they're sprayin' on the White Rain
Yeah, they're gonna get a rowdy tonight down at the football game

[Chorus]
Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown

[Verse 2]
Well, you can see the neighbors butt crack nailin' on his shingles
And his woman smokin' Pall Malls watchin' Laura Ingalls
And Granny's gettin' lit, she's headin' out to bingo
Yeah, my buddies and me are goin' muddin' down on Blue Hole Road

You know, you know

[Chorus]
Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown

[Interlude]
Oh, stand on it

[Verse 3]
We hear folks in the city party in Martini Bars
And they like to show off in their fancy foreign cars
Out here in the boondocks we buy beer at Amoco
And crank our Kraco speakers with that country radio

[Chorus]
We let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown

Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it's buckwild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown
In a hicktown
Yeah, it's the way we get down
Yeah, in hicktown
Yeah, in hicktown

Aw, we ain't finished yet

[Outro]
Got your country boys and your redneck girls
It's the party heard 'round the world
Right here in hicktown
In hicktown
The whole town's gettin' down

[Chorus]
Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it's buckwild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown
In a hicktown
Yeah, it's the way we get down
Yeah, in hicktown
Yeah, in hicktown

[album version]
We ain't finished yet

Got your redneck boys and your redneck girls
Down here in hicktown[Verse 1]
We went out last night
Like we swore we wouldn't do
Drank too much beer last night
A lot more than we wanted to
There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas
Maine, Alabama and Panama
All mixed together and having a ball

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher
Yeah, life was good everywhere
We went out last night

[Verse 2]
Well you know I'm a music man
I grew up in east Tennessee
Last night I was everything
When I got a few drinks in me
I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were people doing body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night

[Bridge]
Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight

[Chorus 3]
Oh, We went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Everybody started loving on each other
They were dancing on the tables
And howling at the moon
Pairing off together and pretty soon
There was not a sole in sight
When we went out last night[Verse 1]
You could say I'm a little bit crazy
You could call me insane
Walking around with all these whispers
Running around here in my brain
I just can't help but hear 'em
Man, I can't avoid it, I hear voices
I hear voices

[Chorus]
Like, my dad saying work that job
But don't work your life away
And momma telling me to drop some cash
Into the offering plate on Sunday
And Granddad saying you can have a few
But don't ever cross that line
Yeah, I hear voices all the time

[Verse 2]
Turns out I'm pretty dang lucky
For all that good advice
Those hard to find words of wisdom
Hold up here in my mind
And just when I lost my way
Or I got too many choices, I hear voices
I hear voices

[Chorus]
Like, my dad saying quit that team
And you'll be a quitter for the rest of your life
And Momma telling me to say a prayer
Every time I lay down at night
And Grandma saying if you find the one
You better treat her right
Yeah, I hear voices all the time

[Bridge]
Sometimes I try to ignore them
But I thank God for them
'Cause they made me who I am

[Chorus]
My dad saying work that job
But don't work your life away
And Momma telling me to drop some cash
In the offering plate on Sunday
And Granddad saying you can have a few
But don't ever cross that line
Yeah, I hear voices all the time

[Outro]
Yeah, I hear voices all the time
All the time[Verse 1]
Ever since I met you girl, you been on my brain
I can’t think of nothing else but you all night and day
It’s like I got a first class seat up on Ozzy’s train
It’s driving me insane

[Chorus]
5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I’m going crazy, thinking ‘bout you baby
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco
I’m going crazy, think I love you baby

[Verse 2]
I gotta get your number girl, I gotta call you up
I gotta get you riding shotgun in my truck
This little bit of you I’ve got, it ain’t good enough
Yeah, you got me all messed up

[Chorus]
5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I’m going crazy, thinking ‘bout you baby
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco
I’m going crazy, think I love you baby

[Verse 3]
Cause I, ain’t never felt like this, no
And I, I just need one kiss, from you
And I’ll be good as new
If I don’t get some of your sweet loving no telling what I might do

[Chorus]
5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po uhm
I think I'm losing my mind girl
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Outro]
5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I’m going crazy, thinking ‘bout you baby
5-1-5-0, spinning my head like a yo-yo
I’m going crazy, think I love you baby[Verse 1]
I got a little drunk last night
There's something 'bout a midnight rain
Staring at the ceiling fan
I couldn't get you off my brain
I guess I wasn't thinking straight
I couldn't tell wrong from right
I went ahead and called you up
I got a little drunk last night

[Pre-Chorus]
Brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth to both of us now?
It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, hit that hurt
You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
Don't know why

[Chorus]
Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk last night

[Verse 2]
I got a little too far gone
Heart was talking way too loud
I don't remember what I said
I just remember breaking down

[Pre-Chorus]
Brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth to both of us now?
It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, hit that hurt
You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
Don't know why

[Chorus]
Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know
Might've been a girl that looked like you
Might've been a fluke, might've been a full moon
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk last night

[Bridge]
Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know
Might've been a girl that looked like you
Might've been a fluke, might've been a full moon
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk

[Pre-Chorus]
Brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth to both of us now?
It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, hit that hurt
You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time

[Outro]
I got a little drunk last night
I got a little drunk last night
Thought I could keep it all inside
But I got a little drunk last night[Verse 1]
I was sitting there, selling turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking, "This is where rednecks come from"
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the Interstate
Needing directions, and I was the man for the job

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

[Verse 2]
I was sitting there, thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat, and thought, you fool, it could have been love
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

[Bridge]
Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me?
Or am I really seeing what I think I see?
The woman of my dreams coming back to me

[Chorus]
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big old glass
And sent her right back here to me

[Outro]
Thank God for good directions, and turnip greens[Verse 1]
It's summer nights baby!
Come on ladies, it's time to pop that top
And fellas, I know you're ready to rock
We went crazy, cooped up all winter long
And school is out so let's get it on
Flip flop tan and some white sand
I know the perfect spot
Well the sunset better set soon so we can get in the mood
Things start gettin' all heated up when it starts gettin' cool
Yeah

[Chorus]
Summer nights
Everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights
Come on -- Oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now fellas, you better watch your step
Don't let them teeny French bikinis make you lose your breath
Back to the ladies - y'all keep doing y'alls thing
Cause everything about you makes me wanna scream
The sun is getting low, there it goes
Here we go, here comes the moon
Things start getting all heated up
When it starts getting cool, yeah

[Chorus]
Summer nights
Everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights

[Bridge]
Oh, it's a party down in Padre
Big bonfire on the beach
It's Coronas in Daytona, y'all
Well, it's wild and it's free

[Chorus]
Summer nights
Everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights
Summer nights
Everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Holler if you're ready for some summer nights

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah are you ready
For some summer nights
Yeah, baby
Summer nights
It's summer nights
Come on[Verse 1]
Roll into town, step off the bus
Shake off the where you came from dust
Grab your guitar, walk down the street
Sign says "Nashville, Tennessee"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I have found

[Chorus]
It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just tryin' to make it
In this crazy town

[Verse 2]
You pay your dues and you play for free
And you pray for a honky tonk destiny
You cut your teeth in the smokey bars
And live off the tips from a pickle jar

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Til you find a cool new sound
And you smile when the record man shoots you down

[Chorus]
It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just tryin' to make it
In this crazy town

[Bridge]
One year they repossess your truck
And the next you make a couple million bucks

[Chorus]
It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just tryin' to make it
We love it, we hate it, we all came here to make it
In this crazy town
It's a crazy town[Verse 1]
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing, I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Bridge]
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

[Outro]
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song[Verse 1]
Well I was rolling wheels and shifting gears
Around that Jersey Turnpike
Barney stopped me with his gun
Ten minutes after midnight
Said sir you broke the limit
In thit rusty old truck
I don't know about that accent son
Just where did you come from

[Chorus]
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

[Verse 2]
Well I was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
The sign said finger-lickin'
Well I paid the tab
And the lady asked me
How'd I like my biscuit
I'll be honest with you ma'am
It ain't like mama fixed it

[Chorus]
Cause where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

[Verse 3]
I was chasing sun on 101
Somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint
And I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
Said no thanks ma'am
Back home We like the girls
That sing soprano

[Chorus]
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

[Verse 4]
Well I was headed home on 65
Somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
That's rolling on like thunder
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
No, but you might have seen me there
I just dropped a load of salsa

[Chorus]
I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

[Chorus]
Where I come from it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of back porch picking
Where I come from trying to make a living
Working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Yeah where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Staring up at heaven
Where I come from
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
Trying to make a living
Oh, where I come from
Where I come from
Yeah where I come from
Get back down there sometimes
Where I come from[Verse 1]
She was storming through the house that day
And I could tell she was leaving
And I thought, aw, she'll be back
Till she turned around and pointed at the wall and said

[Verse 2]
That picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
Just give it away
She said, give it away
And that big four-poster king-size bed
Where so much love was made
Just give it away
She said, just give it away

[Chorus]
Just give it away
There ain't nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh, and we're both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away

[Bridge]
So I tried to move on
But I found that each woman I held
Just reminded me of that day
Hmm

[Verse 3]
When that front door swung wide open
She flung her diamond ring
Said, give it away
Just give it away
And I said, now, honey, don't you even want
Your half of everything
She said, give it away
Just give it away

[Chorus]
Just give it away
There ain't nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh, and we're both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away

[Instrumental interlude]

[Verse 4]
So I'm still right here where she left me
Along with all the other things
She don't care about anymore
Mmm, like that picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
She said, give it away
Well, I can't give it away
And that big four-poster king-size bed
Where all our love was made
She said, give it away
Well, I can't give it away

[Outro]
I've got a furnished house, a diamond ring
And a lonely broken heart
Full of love and I can't even give it away[Intro]
Yeah yeah
That's right

[Verse 1]
We talk about your work, how your boss is a jerk
We talk about your church and your head when it hurts
We talk about the troubles you've been having with your brother
About your daddy and your mother and your crazy ex-lover
We talk about your friends and the places that you've been
We talk about your skin and the dimples on your chin
The polish on your toes and the run in your hose
And God knows we're gonna talk about your clothes
You know talking about you makes me smile
But every once in awhile

[Chorus]
I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one
Oh my, me my
What I think, what I like, what I know, what I want, what I see
I like talking about you, you, you, you, usually, but occasionally
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)

[Verse 2]
We talk about your dreams and we talk about your schemes
Your high school team and your moisturizer cream
We talk about your nanna up in Muncie, Indiana
We talk about your grandma down in Alabama
We talk about your guys of every shape and size
The ones that you despise and the ones you idolize
We talk about your heart, about your brains and your smarts
And your medical charts and when you start
You know talking about you makes me grin
But every now and then

[Chorus]
I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one
Oh my me my
What I think, what I like, what I know, what I want, what I see
I like talking about you, you, you, you, usually, but occasionally
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
(I wanna talk about me) (me, me, me, me)
(I wanna talk about me) (me, me, me, me)

[Bridge]
You you you you you you you you you you you you you
I wanna talk about me

[Chorus]
I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one
Oh my me my
What I think, what I like, what I know, what I want, what I see
I like talking about you, you, you, you, usually, but occasionally
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
Oh me[Verse 1]
Doublewide Quick Stop midnight T-top
Jack in her Cherry Coke town
Momma and Daddy put their roots right here
‘Cause this is where the car broke down
Yellow dawn school bus kickin’ up red dust
Pickin’ us up by a barbed wire fence
MTV on the RCA, no A/C in the vents

[Chorus]
We were Jesus saved me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin’, front seat leanin’
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin’ up in little pink houses
Makin’ out on living room couches
Blowin’ that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up, but we’re all alright

[Verse 2]
Baptist church parkin’ lot, tryin’ not to get caught
Take her home and give her your jacket
Makin’ it to second base, but sayin’ you went all the way
Monday afternoon at practice
Sister's got a boyfriend Daddy doesn’t like
Now he’s sittin’ out back, .30-.30 in his lap
In the blue bug zapper light

[Chorus]
We were Jesus saved me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin’, front seat leanin’

Man, I've been working too hard
Ten hour days and I'm tired
Damn this knuckle busted'
Back breakin', no paying job
Know where I'm goin from here
Hot headed women, cold beer
Kick up my heels for a little while
And do it country style

[Chorus]
In my dirty 'ole hat
With my crooked little grin
Granny beaded neck
And these calloused hands
And a muddy pair of jeans
With that copenhagen ring
No need to change a thing, hey y'all
I'm going out with my boots on

[Verse 2]
How I keep catching her eye
Man, I keep wondering why
Ain't nothing special 'bout
An "awe shucks" country boy
Lord, she's sure lookin' good
Like something from Hollywood
She got me thinkin' that I just might
Leave here with her tonight

[Chorus]
In my dirty 'ole hat
With my crooked little grin
Granny beaded neck
And these calloused hands
And a muddy pair of jeans
With that copenhagen ring
No need to change a thing, hey y'all
I'm going out with my boots on

[Verse 3]
Cause I am who I am and that's
The man I'm gonna be, yeah
And when the Lord comes callin'
Well, he ain't gonna have
To holler, y'all
There'll be no trouble finding me

[Chorus]
In my dirty 'ole hat
With my crooked little grin
Granny beaded neck
And these calloused hands
And a muddy pair of jeans
With that copenhagen ring
No need to change a thing, hey y'all
I'm going out with my boots on

[Outro]
With my boots on
He's gonna take me home
Lord, with my boots on[Verse 1]
Baby why you wanna cry?
You really oughta know that I
Just have to walk away sometimes
We’re gonna do what lovers do
We’re gonna have a fight or two
But I ain’t ever changin’ my mind

[Chorus]
Crazy girl, don’t you know that I love you?
And I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl

[Verse 2]
Wouldn’t last a single day
I’d probably just fade away
Without you, I’d lose my mind
Before you ever came along
I was livin’ life all wrong
Smartest thing I ever did was make you all mine

[Chorus]
Crazy girl, don’t you know that I love you?
And I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl
Like crazy, girl

[Chorus]
Crazy girl, don’t you know that I love you?
And I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like
Crazy, girl, don’t you know that I love you?
I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl

[Outro]
Like crazy, oh, crazy girl
Like crazy, oh, crazy girl[Verse 1]
This old man and me
Were at the bar and we
Were having us some beers and
Swapping I don't cares
Talking politics
Blonde and red-haired chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked
We talked about God's grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say

[Chorus]
God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

[Verse 2]
He said "I fought two wars
Been married and divorced"
What brings you to Ohio?
He said "Damned if I know"
We talked an hour or two
'Bout every girl we knew
What all we put them through
Like two old boys will do
We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
He said "These damn things will kill me yet"

[Chorus]
But God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

[Verse 3]
Last call is 2 a.m
I said goodbye to him
I never talk to him again
Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary
He was a millionaire-y
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
But me, I'm doing well

[Bridge]
And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said

[Chorus]
God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy
God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy
God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy[Verse 1]
You were too bad for a little square town
With your hip-hop hat and your pants on the ground
Heard you cussed out mamma, pushed daddy around
Before you took off in his car
Here you are runnin' these dirty old streets
Tattoo on your neck, fake gold on your teeth
Got the hood here snowed, but you can't fool me
We both know who you are

[Chorus]
Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty
Little house little kids little small town story
If you don't ever do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy

[Verse 2]
I was haulin' this hay, to Uncle Joe's farm
I thought of us bare foot kids in the yard
Man it seems we were just catchin' snakes in the barn
Now you're caught up in this mess
I can use a little help unloadin' these bales
I can keep ya pretty busy with a hammer and a nail
Ain't a glamorous life, but it'll keep you outta jail
And not worry us all to death

[Chorus]
Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty
Little house little kids little small town story
If you don't ever do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy
Come on home, boy

[Bridge]
Homeboy... Yeah...
You can't hold back the hands of time
Mamas goin' grey and so is Daddy's mind
I wish you'd come on back and make it all right
Before they're called...home, boy

[Outro]
Homeboy
Come on home, boy
Homeboy
Come on home, boy[Intro]
This is for all you sophisticated ladies out there

[Verse 1]
She grew up in the city in a little subdivision
Her daddy wore a tie, mama never fried a chicken
Ballet, straight-As, most likely to succeed
They bought her a car after graduation
Sent her down South for some higher education
Put her on the fast track to a Law Degree
Now she's coming home to visit
Holding the hand of a wild-eyed boy
With a farmers tan

[Chorus]
Shes riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Charlie Daniels, yelling, Turn it up!
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid
Ladies love country boys

[Verse 2]
You know mamas and daddies want better for their daughters
Hope they'll settle down with a doctor or a lawyer
And their uptown, ball gown, hand-me-down royalty
They never understand why their princess falls
For some camouflage britches and a southern-boy-drawl

[Chorus]
She's riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Hank Jr., yelling, turn it up
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid, ladies love country boys

[Bridge]
You can train them, you can try to teach them
Right from wrong but its still going to turn them on

[Chorus]
She's riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Lynyrd Skynyrd, yelling, turn it up
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid, ladies love country boys

[Outro]
They love us country boysGonna drive like hell through your neighbourhood
Park this Silverado on your front lawn
Crank up a little Hank
Sit on the hood and drink
I'm about to get my pissed off on

I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didn't come here to start a fight, but I'm up for anything tonight
You know you broke the wrong heart, baby
And drove me redneck crazy

Wish I knew how long it's been going on
How long you've been getting some on the side
Nah, he can't amount to much by the look of that little truck
Well, he won't be getting any sleep tonight

I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didn't come here to start a fight, but I'm up for anything tonight
You know you broke the wrong heart, baby
And drove me redneck crazy
Redneck crazy

Did you think I'd wish you both the best
Endless love and happiness?
You know that's just not the kind of man I am
Yeah, I'm the kind that shows up at your house at 3 A.M

I'm gonna aim my headlights into your bedroom windows
Throw empty beer cans at both of your shadows
I didn't come here to start a fight
But I'm up for anything tonight
You've gone and broke the wrong heart, baby
And drove me redneck crazy
You drove me redneck crazy, oh, yeah[Verse 1]
When the lights go down
And you're stuck here in this town
With nowhere to go
So you escape through the radio

And you worked all week
To barely make ends meet
Well, I gotta a little cash burning holes in my pocket
Foot on the gas, taking off like a rocket

[Chorus]
So come on, come on, baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
Tonight, tonight, baby, we're drinking
Let's wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money

[Verse 2]
We can dance in the dark
Blow the speakers out of this car
Light it up, burn it down
Until the morning rolls around

In a field where we can scream
Get away with almost anything
Yeah, every now and then you gotta raise a little hell
Hope we get lucky and stay out of jail

[Chorus]
So come on, come on, baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
Tonight, tonight, baby, we're drinking
Let's wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money

[Chorus]
So come on, come on, baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
Tonight, tonight, baby, we're drinking
Let's wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money

[Outro]
So come on, come on
Yeah, come on, come on[Verse 1: Keifer]
We were sitting up there on your momma's roof
Talking 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move

[Verse 2: Keifer]
Oh but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me

[Chorus: Keifer & Shawna]
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're about to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or what?

[Verse 3: Keifer]
It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand

[Verse 4: Keifer]
So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me

[Chorus: Keifer & Shawna]
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

[Verse 5]
[Keifer & Shawna]
So we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
[Keifer]
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle

[Verse 6]
[Keifer & Shawna]
When the preacher man said, "Say I do"
I did and you did too
[Keifer]
Then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

[Chorus: Keifer & Shawna]
Are we gonna do this or what?
Look at all the love that we got
It ain't never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

[Tag]
[Keifer]
Yeah baby I love you a lot
[Keifer & Shawna]
I really think we've got a shot
[Keifer]
Are you gonna kiss me or not?[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match an all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn[Verse 1]
Back this hitch up into the water
Untie all the cables and rope
Step onto the astro turf
Get yourself a coozie
Let's go

Who said anything about skiing?
Floating is all I want to do
You can climb the ladder
Just don't rock the boat while I barbeque

[Chorus]
On the pontoon
Making waves and catching rays up on the roof
Jumping out the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
Out here in the open
Mmmmmmm motorboating

[Bridge]
(Hoo hoo hoo)

[Verse 2]
Reach your hand down into the cooler
Don't drink it if the mountains aren't blue
Try to keep it steady as you recline on your black inner tube

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Hoo hoo hoo)
(Hoo hoo hoo)

[Bridge]
5 mile an hour with aluminum side
Wood paneling with a water slide
Can't beat the heat, so let's take a ride

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
On the pontoon
(Hoo hoo hoo)
On the pontoon
(Hoo hoo hoo)

Back this hitch out into the water
On the pontoon

[Outro]
(Hoo hoo hoo)
(Hoo hoo hoo)[Verse 1]
Would you go with me if we rolled down streets of fire
Would you hold on to me tighter as the summer sun got higher
If we roll from town to town and never shut it down
Would you go with me if we were lost in fields of clover
Would we walk even closer until the trip was over
And would it be okay if I didn't know the way

[Chorus]
If I gave you my hand
Would you take it and make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Let me know if you're really a dream
I love you so
So would you go with me

[Verse 2]
Would you go with me if we rode the clouds together
Could you not look down forever
If you were lighter than a feather
Oh, and if I set you free, would you go with me

[Chorus]
If I gave you my hand
Would you take it and make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Help me tie up the ends of a dream
I gotta know, would you go with me
I love you so, so would you go with me

[Verse 1]
If you ain't got two kids by 21
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday morning you best be
There in the front row, like you're s'posed to
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

[Chorus]
Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

[Verse 2]
We think the first time's good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

[Chorus]
Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
Mary Mary quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

[Outro]
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn no more[Intro: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelley]
"Hey, sorry I missed your call, just leave a message after the beep"
"Hey, yeah, it's me, just been thinking about everything that night
I don't know, I just miss you so much
Can you call me back?"

[Verse 1: Hillary Scott]
Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

[Pre-Chorus: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelley]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

[Chorus: Lady Antebellum]
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

[Verse 2: Charles Kelley]
Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Antebellum & Charles Kelley]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

[Chorus: Lady Antebellum]
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
Whoa, oh

[Bridge: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelley]
I guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

[Chorus: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelley & Lady Antebellum]
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

[Outro: Lady Antebellum & Hillary Scott]
I just need you now
Oh baby, I need you now[Verse 1]
Well we grew up down by the railroad tracks
Shootin' BBs at old beer cans
Chokin' on the smoke from a Lucky Strike
Somebody lifted off of his old man
We were football flunkies
Southern rock junkies
Crankin' up the stereos
Singin' loud and proud to "Gimme Three Steps,"
"Simple Man," and "Curtis Loew"
We were good you know

[Verse 2]
Got some discount knowledge at the junior college
Where we majored in beer and girls
It was all real funny 'til we ran out of money
And they threw us out into the world
Yeah the kids that thought they'd run this town
Ain't runnin' much of anything
Just lovin' and laughin'
And bustin' our asses
And we call it all livin' the dream

[Chorus]
And these are my people
This is where I come from
We're givin' this life everything we've got and then some
It ain't always pretty
But it's real
It's the way we were made
Wouldn't have it any other way
These are my people

[Verse 3]
Well we take it all week on the chin with a grin
Till we make it to a Friday night
And it's church league softball, holler 'bout a bad call
Preacher breakin' up the fight
Then later on at the Green Light Tavern
Well everybody's gatherin' as friends
And the beers are pourin' till Monday mornin'
And we start it all over again

[Chorus]
And these are my people
This is where I come from
We're givin' this life everything we've got and then some
It ain't always pretty
But it's real
It's the way we were made
Wouldn't have it any other way
These are my people

[Bridge]
We fall down, and we get up
We walk proud, and we talk tough
We got heart, and we got nerve
Even if we are a bit disturbed

[Chorus]
And these are my people
This is where I come from
We're givin' this life everything we've got and then some
It ain't always pretty
But it's real
It's the way we were made
Wouldn't have it any other way
Ah nah
These are my people[Verse 1]
He didn't have to wake up
He'd been up all night
Laying there in bed listening
To his new born baby cry
He makes a pot of coffee
He splashes water on his face
His wife gives him a kiss and says
It is going to be OK

[Chorus]
It won't be like this for long
One day soon we'll look back laughing
At the week we brought her home
This phase is going to fly by
So baby just holds on
It won't be like this for long

[Verse 2]
Four years later bout four thirty
She's crawling in their bed
And when he drops her off at preschool
She's clinging to his leg
The teacher peels her off of him
He says what can I do
She says now do not you worry
This will only last a week or two

[Chorus]
It won't be like this for long
One day soon you'll drop her off
And she won't even know you're gone
This phase is going to fly by
If you could just hold on
It won't be like this for long

[Verse 3]
Someday soon she will be a teenager
And at times he'll think she hates him
Then he'll walk her down the aisle
And he'll raise her veil
But right now she up and crying
And the truth is that he do not mind
As he kisses her good night
And she says her prayers
He lays down there beside her
Till her eyes are finally closed
And just watching her it breaks his heart
Cause he already knows

[Chorus]
It won't be like this for long
One day soon that little girl is going to be
All grown up and gone
Yeah this phase is going to fly by
He is trying to hold on
It won't be like this for long
It won't be like this for long[Verse 1]
You were raised on an asphalt farm
Ain't never heard a rooster crow
Never walked barefoot by a river
Felt the mud up between your toes

[Bridge]
You never rolled in the hay
You never thrown it in four wheel
Climb up on in here girl
Let me show you how country feels

[Chorus]
Let your hair down, hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels

[Verse 2]
Never watched the sun go down
From the bed of a pickup truck
Ever been so into somebody
You're still lying there when it comes back up

[Bridge]
Girl what do you say?
Cut a path through that cornfield
Park down by the water
Let me show you how country feels

[Chorus]
Let your hair down, hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels

Let your hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off

[Chorus]
Let your hair down, hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how
Country feels

Country feels[Verse 1]
It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh, a sailor’s sky made a perfect sunset
And that's the day I'll never forget

[Chorus]
I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

[Verse 2]
Well it was five years later on a southbound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past
Coming from a few rows back
And when I looked, I couldn't believe just what I saw
She said I bet you don't remember me
And I said only every other memory

[Chorus]
I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
You had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

[Bridge]
Like an old photograph
Time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of a first love
Never fades away

[Chorus]
I had a barbecue stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
A heart don’t forget, no a heart don’t forget
I said a heart don’t forget something like that
Oh, not something like that[Verse 1]
Rifle in a gun rack hanging in the back glass
Buck knife on my belt, ain't no land for sale 'round here
Red clay country mud, sipping on a cold Bud
Blue tick coon hound you know where I'm found

[Chorus]
Out in the backwoods down in the holler
Out in the backwoods, working hard for a dollar in the
Backwoods yeah we get it done right
Work hard, play hard, hold my baby tight
Lordy have mercy it's a real good life
In the backwoods, yes sir

[Verse 2]
Preacher's daughter couldn't get hotter
Floating that river on an inner tube with her, splash
35's and a lift kit how stuck can you get
Ain't that just my luck where's the chain I'm stuck

[Chorus]
Out in the backwoods down in the holler
Out in the backwoods, working hard for a dollar In the Backwoods yeah we get it done right
Work hard, play hard, hold my baby tight
Lordy have mercy it's a real good life
In the backwoods, yes sir

Out in the backwoods down in the holler
Out in the backwoods, working hard for a dollar In the Backwoods yeah we get it done right
Work hard, play hard, hold my baby tight
Lordy have mercy it's a real good life
In the backwoods, down in the holler son
Down in the backwoods[Verse 1]
I got a funny feelin'
The moment that your lips touched mine
Somethin' shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time
There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity

[Chorus]
You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around
They're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again

[Bridge]
Everybody swears we make the perfect pair
But dancin' is as far as it goes
Girl you've never moved me quite
Quite the way you moved me tonight
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to know

[Chorus]
You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
And we'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around
They're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again

[Verse 1]
I know where I come from:
How 'bout you?
I don't need baggy clothes
Or rings in my nose to be cool
The scars on my knuckles
Match these scuffs on these cowboy boots
An' there's a whole lot more like me:
How 'bout you?
I punch the clock trying' to make it to the top:
How 'bout you?
I aren’t got no blue-blood trust fund
I can dip in to
Yeah, I wish Uncle Sam would give a damn
About the man who's collar's blue
But if he don't, hell, I'll make it on my own:
How 'bout you?

[Chorus]
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few
But that's just me:
How 'bout you?

[Verse 2]
I still say: "Yes, Ma'am" to my Momma:
How 'bout you?
If I shake your hand, look you in the eye
You can bet your ass, it'll be the truth
I cover my heart with my hat
When they fly that Red, White and Blue
Just like my Daddy taught me:
How 'bout you?

[Chorus]
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few
But that's just me:
How 'bout you?

[Verse 3]
I like my country rocking'
How 'bout you?
Just put me on a stage, man
Turn it up an' I'll turn it loose
Yeah, give me a crowd that's redneck an' loud
We'll raise the roof
Hell, I might just stay all night long
How 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
Cause, man, I know where I come from:
How 'bout you?[Verse 1]
You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green, girl
I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you're wanted too

[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted

[Verse 2]
Anyone can tell you you're pretty
You get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the makeup
And I wanna show you what I see tonight

[Chorus]
When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
'Cause baby I, wanna make you feel wanted

[Bridge]
As good as you make me feel
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're more than everything I need
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted

[Chorus/Outro]
And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted
Yeah, baby I wanna make you feel
Wanted

[Outro]
Cause you'll always be wanted[Verse 1]
I remember when I first met you
Sipping coffee in a corner booth
You were twirling your hair
And I just had to stare
For a minute or two

[Verse 2]
I was laughing at your stack of books
Then you shot me that smile
Hey beautiful girl, in your own little world
Let me in it

[Pre-Chorus]
You got all of my attention
And you ain't even trying
Yeah, you're my kind of different
And I never seen nothing

[Chorus]
Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you

[Verse 2]
When you're wearing them worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealing my heart like a gypsy

[Verse 3]
I love the way that you kiss me
In front of everybody
So baby come and kiss me
They ain't ever seen nothing

[Chorus]
Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you, yeah
Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Nothing like you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you

[Outro]
Never seen, never seen nothing like you
Ain't never seen anything like you
Never seen nothin' like you[Verse 1]
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you what you’re thinking about
You'll see a good boy (You'll see a good boy)
Gonna give you the world
But he’s gonna leave you crying with your heart in the dirt
His lips are dripping honey, but he’ll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your love and go and throw away the key
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man

[Chorus]
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go
Better listen to me, he’s low, low, low

[Verse 2]
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding and a hand you can hold
Just like you should, girl (Just like you should, girl)
Like every good girl does
Want a fairytale ending, somebody to love
But he’s really good at lying
Yeah, he’ll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever
Well, it don’t mean much
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
So good for him
Better back away, honey, you don’t know where he’s been

[Chorus]
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he’s low
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, he’s no good, girl
Why can’t you see?
He’ll take your heart and break it
Listen to me, yeah

[Chorus]
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won’t you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He’s no good, he’s no good
Won’t you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find

[Outro]
He’s no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes[Verse 1]
I think I’ll take a moment, celebrate my age
The ending of an era and the turning of a page
Now it’s time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord have mercy on my next thirty years

[Verse 2]
Hey my next thirty years I’m going to have some fun
Try to forget about all the crazy things I’ve done
Maybe now I’ve conquered all my adolescent fears
And I’ll do it better in my next thirty years

[Verse 3]
My next thirty years I’m going to settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I’m doing here
In my next thirty years

[Verse 4]
Oh my next thirty years, I’m going to watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers
Maybe I’ll remember my next thirty years

[Verse 5]
My next thirty years will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here, in my next thirty years
In my next thirty years[Verse 1]
I've sure enjoyed the rain
But I'm looking forward to the sun
You have to feel the pain
When you lose the love you gave someone
I thought by now the time
Would take away these lonely tears
I hope you're doing fine all alone
But where do I go from here, 'cause...

[Chorus]
Without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you

[Verse 2]
Well I never thought I'd be lying here without you by my side
It seems unreal to me that the life you promised was a lie
You made it look so easy
Making love into memories
I guess you got what you wanted
But what about me, 'cause...

[Chorus]
Without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you

[Bridge]
Somebody tell my head to try to tell my heart
That I'm better off without you
Because baby, I can't live

[Chorus]
Without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you[Verse 1]
I got no money in my pockets
I got a hole in my jeans
I had a job and I lost it
But it won't get to me

Because I'm riding with my baby
And it's a brand new day
We're on the wheels of an angel
Flying away

[Chorus]
And the sun is shining
This road keeps winding
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't wanna be me

[Verse 2]
Now she's strumming on my six-string
Across her pretty knees
She's stomping out a rhythm
And singing to me the sweetest song

[Chorus]
And the sun is shining
This road keeps winding
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't wanna be me
And the sun is shining
This road keeps winding
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't wanna be me

[Verse 3]
I got no money in my pockets
I got a hole in my jeans
We're on the wheels of an angel
And I'm free
She's strumming on my six-string
It's across her pretty knees
She's stomping out a rhythm
And she's singin' to me[Verse 1]
Winter getting colder, summer getting warmer
Tidal wave coming 'cross the Mexican border
Why buy a gallon, it's cheaper by the barrel
Just don't get busted singing Christmas carols

[Chorus]
That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burning
Funny how the world keeps turning
Look ma, no hands
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride

[Verse 2]
Momma gets her rocks off watching' Desperate Housewives
Daddy works his ass off paying' for the good life
Kids on the YouTube learning how to be cool
Living in a cruel world, pays to be a mean girl

[Chorus]
That's us, That's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burning
Funny how the world keeps turning
Look ma, no hands
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride

[Verse 3]
Poor little infamous, America's town
She gained five pounds and lost her crown
Quick fix plastic surgical antidote
Got herself a record deal, can't even sing a note

[Verse 4]
Plasma getting bigger, Jesus getting smaller
Spill a cup of coffee, make a million dollars
Customs caught a thug with an aerosol can
If the shoe don't fit, fits gonna hit the shan

[Outro]
That's us, That's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burning
Funny how the world keeps turning
Hot dog, Hot damn
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride
Oh yeah
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na nananananananana

[Verse 1]
Summertime is finally here
That old ballpark, man, is back in gear
Out on 49
Man I can see the lights

School's out and the nights roll in
Man, just like a long lost friend
You ain't seen in a while
And can't help but smile

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

[Chorus]
Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

[Verse 2]
Temperature says 93
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee
But that swimming hole
It's nice and cold

Bikini bottoms underneath
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off
Them old cutoffs

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

[Chorus]
Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

[Bridge]
The more things change
The more they stay the same
Don't matter how old you are
When you know what I'm talking 'bout
Yeah baby when you got

[Pre-Chorus]
Two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle Rollin on the floorboard

[Chorus]
Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime[Verse 1]
Staring at you taking off your makeup
Wondering why you even put it on
I know you think you do, but baby, you don't need it
Wish that you could see what I see when it's gone

[Chorus]
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is
A T-shirt hanging off a Dogwood Branch
That river was cold, but we gave love a chance
Yeah, yeah, for me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feeling

[Verse 2]
Yeah, smile and shake your head as if you don't believe me
I'll just sit right here and let you take me back
I'm on that gravel road, look at me
On my way to pick you up
You're standing on the front porch looking just like that
Remember that

[Chorus]
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is
A T-shirt hanging off a Dogwood Branch
That river was cold, but we gave love a chance
Yeah, yeah, for me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feeling

[Outro]
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feeling[Verse 1]
Well, I ain't never been the Barbie Doll type
No, I can't swig that sweet Champagne
I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern
Or in a honky-tonk
Or on a four-wheel-drive tailgate

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I've got posters on my wall
Of Skynyrd, Kid and Strait
Some people look down on me
But I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard
With a baby on my hip

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say "hey, y'all" and "yee-haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 2]
Victoria's Secret
Well, their stuff's real nice
Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing
On a Walmart shelf half-price
And still look sexy (Sexy)
Just as sexy as those models on TV

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I don't need no designer tag
To make my man want me
You may think I'm trashy
A little too hard core
But in my neck of the woods
I'm just the girl next door

[Chorus 2]
Hey, I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say "hey, y'all" and "yee-haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah (Hell yeah!)

[Chorus 3]
I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say "hey, y'all" and "yee-haw"

And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Ol' Bocephus song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah" from the redneck girls
Like me

[Outro]
(Hell yeah!)
Hell yeah!
(Hell yeah!)
Hell yeah!
(Hell yeah!)
I said hell yeah!The kids screaming, phone ringing
Dog barking at the mailman bringing
That stack of bills - overdue
Good morning baby, how are you?
Got a half hour, quick shower
Take a drink of milk but the milk's gone sour
My funny face makes you laugh
Twist the top on and I put it back
There goes the washing machine
Baby, don't kick it
I promise I'll fix it
Long about a million other things

Well, it's ok. It's so nice
It's just another day in paradise
Well, there's no place that
I'd rather be
Well, it's two hearts
And one dream
I wouldn't trade it for anything
And I ask the Lord every night
For just another day in paradise

Friday, you're late
Guess we'll never make our dinner date
At the restaurant you start to cry
Baby, we'll just improvise
Well, plan B looks like
Dominoes' pizza in the candle light
Then we'll tippy toe to our room
Make a little love that's overdue
But somebody had a bad dream
Mama and daddy
Can me and my teddy
Come in to sleep in between?

Yeah it's ok. It's so nice
It's just another day in paradise
Well, there's no place that
I'd rather be
Well, it's two hearts
And one dream
I wouldn't trade it for anything
And I ask the Lord every night
For just another day in paradise

Well, it's ok. It's so nice
It's just another day in paradise
Well, there's no place that
I'd rather be
Two hearts
And one dream
I wouldn't trade it for anything
And I ask the Lord every night
For just another day in paradise

For just another day in paradise
Well, it's the kids screaming. The phone ringing
Just another day
Well, it's Friday. You're late
Oh yeah, it's just another day in paradise[Verse 1]
Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Verse 3]
Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey hey mama rock me
Mama rock me
Mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
You can rock me
Rock me[Verse 1]
I can’t sleep
There is no sleep coming
I’m just lying here thinking about you
I’m in deep
Falling deep into the picture in my mind of everything we’re going to do

Over at the lake and down by the river
You can feel it start to rise
Want to jump in my car, go wherever you are
Because I need you by my side

[Chorus]
It’s going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it’s such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down

[Verse 2]
I want to see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile
One chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I said hi
And that was the beginning of my heart spinning like these wheels in my head tonight

[Chorus]
It’s going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it’s such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down

[Bridge]
The only place that I want to be is where you are
Because anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far

[Chorus]
It’s going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it’s such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down

[Outro]
I swear it’s like you’re waiting for the sun to go down
Waiting on the sun to go down
Hey, yeah
Oh, I’m loving thinking about you
I can't sleep, I’m just lying here thinking about youHey, one, two, three

[Verse 1]
Now, red Solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinking from glass
Hey, red Solo cup is cheap and disposable
And in 14 years, they are decomposable
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
Freddy Mac can kiss my ass
Whoo!

[Chorus]
Red Solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party

[Verse 2]
Now, I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down in front of my pack
Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky
But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admiring at how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hitting
On them to help me get lucky

[Chorus]
Red Solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party

[Verse 3]
Now, I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you, red, will do for this fellow
'Cause you are the Abbott to my Costello
And you are the Fruit to my Loom
Red Solo cup, you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic
And believe me that I am not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say

[Bridge]
Red Solo cup, you're not just a cup
(No! No! No! God, no! )
You're my-you're my (Friend?) friend
(Friend, friend, friend,life-long)
Thank you for being my friend

[Chorus]
Red Solo cup
(That's what I am talking about)
I fill you up
Let's have a party
(Let's have a party)
Let's have a party
(Let's have a party)
I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party

Red Solo cup
Red Solo cup
(I fill you up, let's have a party)
Let's have a party
(Let's have a party)
Let's have a party
(Red Solo cup)
Oh red Solo cup
(I lift you up)
Let's have a party
Proceed to party yeah yeah

[Outro]
(Solo cup, solo cup, solo cup)
(Solo cup, solo cup, solo cup)
(Solo cup, solo cup)[Verse 1]
Baby, here I am again
Kicking dust in the canyon wind
Waiting for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive
Hell bent on getting high
High above the lights of town

[Chorus]
Because you and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

[Verse 2]
Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
There were times I thought you'd win
It's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again

[Chorus]
You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

[Verse 3]
When it comes to you
Oh, the damage I could do
It's always your favorite sins
That do you in

[Chorus]
You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

[Outro]
Never enough
You and tequila
You and tequila (make me crazy)[Verse 1]
Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
Or get yourself in a bind, lose the shirt off your back
Need a floor, need a couch, need a bus fare

[Verse 2]
This is where the rubber meets the road
This is where the cream is gonna rise
This is what you really didn't know
This is where the truth don't lie

[Chorus]
You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think "What's in it for me?"
Or "It's way too far"
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are

[Verse 3]
Everybody wants to slap your back, wants to shake your hand
When you're up on top of that mountain
But let one of those rocks give way, then you slide back down
Look up and see who's around then

[Verse 4]
This ain't where the road comes to an end
This ain't where the bandwagon stops
This is just one of those times when
A lot of folks jump off

[Chorus]
You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think "What's in it for me?"
Or "It's way too far"
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are

[Bridge]
When the water's high
When the weather's not so fair
When the well runs dry
Who's gonna be there?

[Chorus]
You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think "What's in it for me?"
Or "It's way too far"
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are, yeah
You find out who your friends are

[Verse 5]
Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
Man I've been there
Or get yourself in a bind, lose the shirt off your back
Need a floor, need a couch, need a bus fare
Man I've been there
Man I've been there[Intro: Brantley Gilbert]
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town, get up
Yeah, tonight is bottoms up

[Verse 1: Brantley Gilbert]
I see you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde
Going 95, burning down 129, yeah
Looking for the law, while I push my luck
She's riding shotgun like it ain't no thing
Turn the radio up so the girl can sing, right
Pull into the party like "y'all wassup?"

[Chorus: Brantley Gilbert]
Tonight is bottoms up, up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town, get up
Drop a tailgate on ya truck

Pretty little mama looking at ya like that
Make ya wanna slide on in like "girl, what's up?"

[Post-Chorus: Brantley Gilbert]
Yeah, tonight is bottoms up up up
Get 'em up
Tonight is bottoms up up up
Get 'em up

[Verse 2: Brantley Gilbert]
Damn girl, I gotta tip my hat
Never thought a country song would make you move like that, yeah
And she's doing it in Daisy Dukes, girl
She's got ya tapping on a boy's shoulder
"Hey dog, check this out"
And that's how girl do it in the Dirty South, yeah
She'll have you on your knee "can I marry you?"
Yeah

[Chorus: Brantley Gilbert]
Tonight is bottoms up, up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town, get up
Drop a tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at ya like that
Make ya wanna slide on in like "girl, what's up?"

[Post-Chorus: ]
Yeah, tonight is bottoms up up up
Get 'em up
Tonight is bottoms up up up
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Ok, usually when you see me I'm a pretty nice guy
Pretty girl drinkin with me claimin' I don't get high, oh
Whatever you say shawty, betcha you do tonight
You probably ran into me in your neighborhood
Wearin' a Hustle Gang hoodie with a bag full of goodies
That up jump the boogie
Told shawty she will do it and I betchu she'll prove me right
(So pop a bottle turn it up to the sky)

[Bridge: Brantley Gilbert]
Let's give a toast to the good times
All y’all get your drinks up high
Everybody feeling alright
Damn right
'Cause

[Chorus: Brantley Gilbert]
Tonight is bottoms up, up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town, get up
Drop a tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at ya like that
Make ya wanna slide on in like "girl, what's up?"

[Chorus: Brantley Gilbert]
Tonight is bottoms up, up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town, get up
Drop a tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at ya like that
Make ya wanna slide on in like "girl, what's up?"

[Post-Chorus: Brantley Gilbert]
Yeah, tonight is bottoms up up up
Get 'em up
Tonight is bottoms up up up
Get 'em up[Verse 1]
This one's for all you girls about 13
High school can be so rough, can be so mean
Hold onto, on to your innocence
Stand your ground when everyone's giving in

This one's for the girls
This is for all you girls about 25
In a little apartment, just trying to get by
Living on, on dreams and Spaghetti-O's
Wondering where your life is gonna go

[Chorus]
This one's for the girls
Who've ever had a broken heart
Who've wished upon a shooting star
You're beautiful the way you are

This one's for the girls
Who love without holding back
Who dream with everything they have
All around the world
This one's for the girls

[Verse 2]
This is for all you girls about 42
Tossing pennies into the Fountain of Youth
Every laugh, laugh line on your face
Made you who you are today

[Chorus]
This one's for the girls
Who've ever had a broken heart
Who've wished upon a shooting star
You're beautiful the way you are

[Bridge]
Yeah, we're all the same inside
(Same inside)
From 1 to 99

[Chorus]
This one's for the girls
Who've ever had a broken heart
Who've wished upon a shooting star
You're beautiful the way you are[Verse 1]
Imagine a dirt road full of potholes
With a creek bank and some cane poles catching channel cat
I'm a little more country than that
Picture a small town with an old hound
Laying out front of the courthouse
While the old men chew the fat
I'm a little more country than that

[Chorus]
I just want to make sure you know just who your getting under this old hat
'Cause girl I'm I'm not the kind to two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that

[Verse 2]
Think of a Hank song from days gone
With a steel rod that's so strong,  sends chills up your back
I'm a little more country than that
If you want a brick home in a school zone
With the doors locked and alarms on
Girl, you're way off track
I'm a little more country than that

[Chorus]
I just want to make sure you know just who your getting under this old hat
'Cause girl I'm  not the kind to two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm sure that you've heard those three words from lovers but they fell flat
But this ring ain't something that I mean to give you and then take back
I'm a little more country than that

[Outro]
I'm a little more country than that
I'm a little more country than that[Verse 1]
I take off time to time
With those crazy friends of mine
Head out on steel horses
With wheels and we ride

[Verse 2]
We burn up that road to old Mexico
Blend in with the desert
Just we amigos
And we roll

[Chorus]
Cowboys like us sure do have fun
Racing the wind, chasing the sun
Take the long way around back to square one
Today we're just outlaws out on the run
There'll be no regrets, no worries and such
For cowboys like us

[Verse 3]
We talk about living, babies, and women
All that we've lost and all we've been giving
We sing about true love, lie about things we ain't done
Drink one more cold one, come morning get up
And we roll

[Chorus]
Cowboys like us sure do have fun
Racing the wind, chasing the sun
Take the long way around back to square one
Today we're just outlaws out on the run
There'll be no regrets, no worries and such
For cowboys like us
Cowboys like us sure do have fun
Racing the wind, chasing the sun
Take the long way around back to square one
Today we're just outlaws out on the run
There'll be no regrets, no worries and such
For cowboys like us

[Outro]
Cowboys like us[Verse 1]
Here you come knocking on my door baby
Tell me what you got on your mind
I guess those college boys all went home for the summertime
And you’re looking right, looking good, looking like a woman should
So why is it so hard to find
A place to lay your pretty little head down once in a while

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You run on a little tough luck baby
Don’t you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
Come and get it

[Chorus]
Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby?
Who’s your buddy, who’s your friend?
And who’s the one guy that you come running to
When your love life starts tumbling?
I got the money if you got the honey
Let’s cut a deal let’s make a plan
Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby?
Who’s your buddy, who’s your man?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You might’ve run on a little tough luck baby
Don’t you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
So come and get it

[Chorus]
Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby?
Who’s your buddy, who’s your man?[Verse 1]
It's no secret that lately there ain't no escape
And that I've been waking up alone
Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling
That you ain't ever coming home
But today, the tears ain't gonna hit the floor
Cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name
So I'm heading on out the door

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

[Verse 2]
When I turned the ignition I knew I'd been missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened
Two days you're taking all the blame
But a drink or two is a fool proof remedy
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kinda making eyes at me

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

[Verse 3]
There'll be plenty of time for what ifs and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

[Outro]
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day[Verse 1]
Girl I know I don’t know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin
I’m so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good

[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

[Post-Chorus]
And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

[Verse 2]
Going to cuss the morning when it comes
'Cause I know that the rising sun
Ain’t no good for me
'Cause you’ll have to leave
Going to make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Clock on the dash says 3:35
There’s plenty of gas and the night’s still alive

[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

[Post-Chorus]
And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

[Post-Chorus]
And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end
I don’t want this night to end
No I don’t want this night to end[Verse 1: Zac Brown]
We never spoke a word
But every thought she had, I heard
From across the room
We were standing face to face
I couldn't find the words to say
Give me one more move
I don't even know her name
I guess foolish pride's to blame

[Chorus: Zac Brown]
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
And my heart won't tell my mind
To tell my mouth what it should say
I may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away

[Verse 2: Zac Brown & Alan Jackson]
Wise man next to me did say
About the one that got away
Son, I missed my chance
Don't you let regret take place
Of the dreams you have to chase
Ask her to dance
(Go on son)

[Pre-Chorus: Alan Jackson]
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith

[Chorus: Alan Jackson]
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell your mind
To tell your mouth what it should say
You may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away

[Pre-Chorus: Alan Jackson]
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith

[Chorus: Zac Brown & Alan Jackson]
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell your mind
To tell your mouth what it should say
You may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Don't be falling in love as she's walking awayWhen I get where I'm goin'
On the far side of the sky
The first thing that I'm gonna do
Is spread my wings and fly
I'm gonna land beside a lion
And run my fingers through his mane
Or I might find out what it's like
To ride a drop o' rain
Yeah, when I get where I'm goin'
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah, when I get where I'm goin'
Don't cry for me down here
I'm gonna walk with my Grandaddy
And he'll match me step for step
And I'll tell him how I've missed him
Every minute since he left
And then I'll hug his neck
Yeah, when I get where I'm goin'
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah, when I get where I'm goin'
Don't cry for me down here
So much pain and so much darkness
In this world we stumble through
All these questions I can't answer
And so much work to do
But when I get where I'm goin'
And I see my Maker's face
I'll stand forever in the light
Of His amazing grace
Yeah, when I get where I'm goin'
Oh when I get where I'm goin'
There'll be only happy tears
I love you, yeah
I will love and have no fear
When I get where I'm goin'
Yeah, when I get where I'm goin'[Verse 1]
Going to put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine going to wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way

[Chorus]
Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Verse 2: Jimmy Buffett]
Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away

[Chorus]
Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Bridge]
This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be

[Chorus]
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Outro]
Come on in the water's nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a backpack of lies
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise[Verse 1]
8 o’clock on Friday night I’m still at home
All my girls just keep on blowin' up my phone
Sayin', "Come on, he ain’t worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name"
Now there’s only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

[Chorus]
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

[Verse 2]
Tonight I’ll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I’ll let him down easy
'Cause tonight it’s all about dancin' with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

[Chorus]
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

[Bridge]
I’m feelin' that buzz
I’m ready to rock
Ain’t no way I’m gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I’m comin' in hot
Hey bartender
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Hey Bartender
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender
Hey bartender[Click here to read Blake’s story about his tenth #1 single, "Mine Would Be You"]

[Produced by Scott Hendricks]

[Verse 1]
What's your all-time high, your good as it gets?
Your hands down best ever make-up sex?
What's your guilty pleasure, your old go to?
Well if you asked me, mine would be you

[Verse 2]
What's your worst hangover, your best night yet?
Your 90 proof, your Marlboro Red?
The best damn thing you lucked into
That's easy girl, mine would be you

[Chorus]
Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools
Makin' up our own words, laughin' 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever, my finest hour
My wildest dream come true
Mine would be you

[Verse 3]
What's your double dare, your go all in?
The craziest thing you ever did?
Plain as your name in this tattoo
Look on my arm, mine would be you

[Chorus]
Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools
Makin' up our own words, laughin' 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever, my finest hour
My wildest dream come true
Mine would be you

[Bridge]
What's the greatest chapter in your book?
Are there pages where it hurts to look?
What's the one regret you can't work through?
You got it baby, mine would be you
Yeah, you got it baby, mine would be you

[Chorus]
Mine would be you
Taillights fadin', daylight breakin'
Standing there like a fool
When I should've been runnin', yellin' out somethin'
To make you want to hold on to
The best love ever, girl, can you tell me
The one thing you'd rather die than lose?
'Cause mine would be you

[Outro]
Mine would be...you[Verse 1]
She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hand
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss with Bacardi on her lips
And I was done

[Chorus 1]
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

[Verse 2]
The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd
Under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back

[Chorus 1]
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

[Bridge]
She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her

[Chorus 2]
When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I should've known where it was goin'
Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
And I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Yeah, I'm still twisted
Like that old beach roller coaster
Like that old beach roller coaster[Chorus]
I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

[Verse 1]
I can feel that
Muddy water runnin' through my veins
And I can hear that
Lullaby of the midnight train
And it sings to me and sounds familiar

[Chorus]
I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

[Verse 2]
I can taste that honeysuckle
And it's still so sweet
When it grows wild
On the banks down at old Camp Creek
Yeah, and it calls to me like a warm wind blowin'

[Chorus]
I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

[Bridge 1]
It's where I learned about livin'
It's where I learned about love
It's where I learned about workin' hard
And havin' a little was just enough
It's where I learned about Jesus
And knowin' where I stand
You can take it or leave it
This is me, this is who I am

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge 2]
Give me a tin roof, a front porch and a gravel road
And that is home to me, feels like home to me

[Chorus]
I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

You get a line, I'll get a pole
We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole
Five card poker on Saturday night
Church on Sunday mornin'

Church on Sunday mornin'[Verse 1]
You're not supposed to say the word "cancer" in a song
And telling folks Jesus is the answer can rub them wrong
It is not hip to sing about tractors, trucks, little towns, and mama, yeah that might be true
But this is country music and we do

[Verse 2]
Do you like to drink a cold one on the weekend and get a little loud
Do you want to say I'm sorry or I love you but you don't know how?
Do you wish somebody had the nerve to tell that stupid boss of yours
To shove it next time he yells at you?
Well this is country music and we do

[Bridge]
So turn it on, turn it up, and sing along
This is real; this is your life in a song
Yeah this is country music

[Verse 3]
Are you haunted by the echo of your mother on the phone
Crying as she tells you that your brother is not coming home?
And if there's anyone that still has pride and the memory of those
That died defending the old red, white, and blue
This is country music and we do

[Verse 4]
So turn it on, turn it up, and sing along
This is real; this is your life in a song
Just like a road that takes you home
Yeah this is right where you belong
This is country music
This is country music
He Stopped Loving Her Today
Hello Darling
God Bless the USA
Amarillo by the Morning
Stand by your Man
Mama Tried
Take Me Home
I Walk the Line
Country Boy Can Survive[Intro]
Alright, alright
Yeah, it's alright, alright

[Verse 1]
Don't need no five star reservations
I got spaghetti and a cheap bottle of wine
Don't need no concert in the city
I got a stereo and the 'Best Of Patsy Cline'

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't got no caviar, no Dom Perignon
But as far as I can see I got everything I want

[Hook]
Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me

[Verse 2]
Maybe later on we'll walk down to the river
Lay on a blanket and stare up at the moon
It may not be no French Riviera
But it's all the same to me as long as I'm with you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
May be a simple life but that's okay, yeah
If you ask me baby, I think I've got it made

[Hook]
Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me

[Bridge]
When I lay down at night I thank the lord above
For giving me everything I ever could dream of

[Hook]
Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me[Intro]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs"
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 2]
She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck"

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 3]
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right

[Verse 4]
I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell, I can't get you out of my head

[Interlude]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it (Come on)
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Outro]
Come on, girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aww, yeah[Verse 1]
Well, all the parties on the streets are talkin'
Store front mannequins sleeping in the lights
We used to smoke while we were jay-walking
Like it was your birthday every other Saturday night
Knew the bands so we never payed our cover
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles
We never dressed to impress all the others
They would let us in on our laid back kinda style
But boy, you know it's been a while

[Chorus]
And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
You talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh, anymore

[Verse 2]
I got some platforms sitting in the corner
They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk
I got a dress that'll show a little uh-uh
But you ain't getting uh-uh
If you don't come pick me up (Damn)
Show me off (Wow)
You might be tired, but I'm not

[Chorus]
And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
You talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
Talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh, anymore

[Outro]
Yeah, don't know why you don't take me downtown
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
I just don't get it[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
Oh man, you've got to watch where you're steppin' around here
Yeah, I got a friend in New York City
He's never heard of Conway Twitty
Don't know nothin' 'bout grits and greens
Never been south of Queens
But he flew down here on a business trip
I took him honky tonkin' and that was it
He took to it like a pig to mud, like a cow to cud

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but a hollerin', Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you got to admit that's in them genes
Aren’t nothing wrong, just gettin' on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton, Trace Adkins, Both]
Nah, you ain’t gotta be born out in the sticks
With an F-150 and a 30-06
Or have a bubba in the family tree
To get on down with me
Yeah, bubba, all you need is an open mind
If it fires you up you got to let it shine
When it feels so right that it can't be wrong
Come on, come on, come on
You ain't alone, you ain't alone

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts bangin' and the fiddle saws
You can't help but a hollerin' Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you got to admit that it's in them genes
Ain’t nothin' wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
Come on y'all
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide
And when the band starts bangin' and the fiddle saws
You can't help but a hollerin', Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man, you got to admit that's in them genes
Aren’t nothing wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
Hillbilly bone ba-bone ba-bone bone
Hillbilly bone ba-bone ba-bone bone
Hillbilly bone ba-bone ba-bone bone

[Outro: Trace Adkins]
I've always wanted to sing the bone song[Verse 1]
I know they say "You can’t go home again"
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

[Chorus]
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

[Verse 2]
Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to Mama's dream

[Chorus]
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

[Bridge]
You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am

[Chorus]
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could walk around, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me[Verse 1]
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
A "No trespass" sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal?
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field

[Verse 2]
And there's somethin' 'bout beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
There's somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice

[Verse 3]
And there's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field (Hah), will make a boy a mess
There's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress

[Verse 4]
And there's somethin' bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more

[Chorus]
And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

[Verse 5]
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang 'em on a limb
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM

[Chorus]
And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Hah[Verse 1]
Windows down, country sound, FM on the radio
Just me and you and the man on the moon
Cruisin' down some old back road

[Pre-Chorus]
Now baby, don't you look at me that way
'Cause you know there's only so much I can take
'Cause you make me wanna

[Chorus]
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop, I'm gonna
Girl, you make me wanna

[Verse 2]
You know better than to wear that dress
It oughta be against the law
Plain and simple, girl, them dimples
Know just how to turn me on

[Pre-Chorus]
Now baby, don't you look at me that way
'Cause you know there's only so much I can take
'Cause you make me wanna

[Chorus]
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop, I'm gonna
Girl, you make me wanna

[Bridge]
You make me wanna
Wake up with you, in the bed of my truck
And start over again when the sun comes up

[Chorus]
You make me wanna
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop, I'm gonna
You make me wanna
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop, I'm gonna
Girl, you make me wanna
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Windows down, country sound, FM on the radio[Verse 1: Kenny Chesney]
Sun tanned toes tickling the sand
Cold drink chilling in my right hand
Watchin' you sleep in the evening light
Resting up for a long, long night

[Chorus]
Because when the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

[Verse 2: Uncle Kracker]
All day long just takin' it easy
Laying in the hammock where it's nice and breezy
Sleeping off the night before
Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be back for more

[Chorus]
Because when the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

[Verse 3: Kenny Chesney & Uncle Kracker]
This old guitar and my dark sunglasses
This sweet concoction is smooth as molasses
Nothing to do but breathe all day
Until the big moon rises and it's time to play

[Chorus]
Because when the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

[Outro]
We'll be feeling alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Uncle Kennys' hotter when the sun goes down

[Chorus]
Because when the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

[Intro]
It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

[Verse 1]
Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

[Hook]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long

[Verse 2]
Catching wild life from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

[Hook]
While we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long

[Verse 3]
Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

[Hook]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long

[Outro]
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long[Verse 1]
Dontcha look now oh the parking lots full
Gonna ride that cow with a Dallas bull
Everybody in the ATL is coming

Got a Black Ford not a White Mercedes
Walking in the front door checking out the ladies
My buddy says "hey boys, I'm buying"
The hottest girl in here's giving me the eye and

[Chorus]
Everybody knows, it's gonna be one of those

Turning all the wrongs into right

Everybody knows, it's gonna be one of those

She wants her nails painted black
She wants the toy in the Cracker Jack
She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo
She wants to wear my shirt to bed
She wants to make every stray a pet
And drive around in my truck with no place to go

[Chorus]
But she needs to feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She’s everything I want and more
A real desire, that lets her know I’d walk alone out on the wire
To make her feel that fire

[Verse 2]
She wants a cabin in the woods
She wants to stand where nobody stood
Someday she wants a couple kids of her own
She wants to make love on a train
Some day’s she only wants a break
Hey she wants what she wants, and man I know I know I know

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So as long as there’s a breath to take
A smile to share, A prayer to bring
A chance to hold her hand and fan the flame
She’s gonna feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She’s everything I want and more
A real desire, that lets her know I’d walk alone out on the wire
Yeah to make her feel that fire. Whoa
Feel that fire

[Outro]
She wants her nails painted black
She wants the toy in the Cracker Jack
She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo[Verse 1]
I'm waitin' on the sun to set 'cause yesterday ain't over yet
I started smoking cigarettes, there's nothing else to do I guess
Dusty roads ain't made for walkin', spinnin' tires ain't made for stoppin'
I'm givin' up on love 'cause love's given up on me

[Verse 2]
I gave it everything I had and everything I got was bad
Life ain't hard, but it's too long to live it like some country song
Trade the truth in for a lie, cheatin' really ain't a crime
I'm givin' up on love 'cause love's given up on me

[Verse 3]
Forget your high society, I'm soakin' it in kerosene
Light 'em up and watch them burn, teach them what they need to learn; ha!
Dirty hands ain't made for shakin', ain't a rule that ain't worth breakin'
Well, I'm givin' up on love 'cause love's given up on me

[Verse 4]
Now I don't hate the one who left
You can't hate someone who's dead
He's out there holdin' on to someone, I'm holdin' up my smoking gun
I'll find somewhere to lay my blame the day she changes her last name
Well, I'm givin' up on love 'cause love's given up on me
Well, I'm givin' up on love, hey, love's given up on me[Verse 1]
Well I love her
But I love to fish
I spend all day out on this lake
And hell is all I catch
Today she met me at the door
Said I would have to choose
If I hit that fishing hole today
She'd be packing all her things
And she'd be gone by noon

[Chorus]
Well, I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lakeshore
And I'm sitting in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Yeah, I'm going miss her
Oh, look there, I've got a bite!

[Verse 2]
Now there's a chance that if I hurry
I could beg her to stay
But that water's right
And the weather's perfect
No telling what I might catch today

[Chorus]
So, I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lakeshore
And I'm sitting in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Yeah, I'm gonna miss her
Oh, look there, another bite!

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm gonna miss her
Oh, look there, I've got a bite![Verse 1]
"Jack and Diane" painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

[Chorus]
I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Driving my first love out to the levee
Living life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

[Verse 2]
I used to rock all night long to "Keep On Rocking Me Baby"
Frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

[Chorus]
And I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinking goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

[Bridge]
We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

[Chorus]
So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir
Singing bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now "Only The Good Die Young" stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song
I go back

[Verse 3]
I go back
To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back (I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back (I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back, I go back, I go back[Verse 1]
Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hangin' off her hips
Eyes sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Homemade jar of lemon drop, take a sip
Don't stop, girl, you know I love it when you

[Chorus]
Get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rockin' all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby, get your shine on, shine on
Baby, get your shine on

[Verse 2]
Silverado, candy painted
Ray-Bans got the whole world shaded
Chrome piece tucked in the console
Ridin' high, roll up on the down low
Feelin' lucky, got hooked up with some Kentucky clear
So slide that little sugar shaker over here

[Chorus]
And get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rockin' all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby, get your shine on, shine on
Baby, get your shine on

[Bridge]
Homemade jar of lemon drop, take a sip
Don't stop, girl

[Chorus]
You know I love it when you get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rockin' all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby, get your shine on, shine on
Baby, get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rockin' all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby, get your shine on, shine on
Baby, get your shine on
Baby, get your shine on

[Outro]
Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hangin' off her hips
Eyes sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Silverado, candy painted
Ray-Bans got the whole world shaded
Chromed piece tucked in the console
Riding high, roll up on the down low
Baby, get your shine on[Intro]
Woke up late today and I still feel the sting of the pain
But I brushed my teeth anyway
I got dressed through the mess and put a smile on my face
I got a little bit stronger

[Verse 1]
Riding in the car to work and I'm
Trying to ignore the hurt so I
Turned on the radio
Stupid song made me think of you
I listened to it for minute
But then I changed it
I'm getting a little bit stronger
Just a little bit stronger

[Chorus]
And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger

[Verse 2]
It doesn't happen overnight but you
Turn around and a month's gone by
And you realize you haven't cried
I'm not giving you a hour or a second or another minute longer
I'm busy getting stronger

[Chorus]
And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger

[Bridge]
Getting along without you baby
I'm better off without you baby
How does it feel without me baby?
I'm getting stronger without you baby

[Chorus]
And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger

[Outro]
And just a little bit stronger
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit stronger
Get a little bit stronger[Verse 1]
It was our first week at Myrtle Beach
Where it all began
It was 102, nothin' to do
Man, it was hot, so we jumped in

[Pre-Chorus]
We were summertime sippin', sippin'
Sweet tea kissin' off of your lips
T-shirt drippin', drippin' wet
How could I forget?

[Chorus]
Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried that day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of 19 you and me

[Verse 2]
We had our first dance in the sand
It was one hell of a souvenir
Tangled up, so in love
You said, "Let's just stay right here"

[Pre-Chorus]
'Til the sun starts creepin', creepin' up
Right then, I knew
Just what you were thinkin', thinkin' of
When I looked at you

[Chorus]
Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried that day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of 19 you and me, yeah, oh
You and me

[Bridge]
Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
Beautiful (Beautiful), beautiful

[Chorus]
Watching that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful (Beautiful)
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down (Of every wave crashin' down)
Like the tears we cried that day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of 19 you and me
Mmm

[Outro]
First week, Myrtle Beach
Where it all began[Verse 1]
Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

[Chorus]
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, "I'm drunk"
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom polo
Oh, and he don't know

[Chorus]
Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Bridge]
I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Outro]
Oh, maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats
Oh[Verse 1]
Friday night and the moon is high
I'm wide-awake just watching you sleep
And I promise you you're going to have
More than just the things that you need
We have not got much now, we’re just starting out
But I know somehow paradise is coming

[Chorus]
Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's going to shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life

[Verse 2]
Oh now there's a place for you and me
Where we can dream as big as the sky
I know it's hard to see it now
But baby someday we're going to fly
This road we're on, you know it might be long
But my faith is strong
It's all that really matters

[Chorus]
Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life

[Bridge]
So hold on, hold on
Come on baby, hold on
Yeah, we're gonna have it all
And ooh

[Chorus]
Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life
Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life

[Outro]
Oh, a better life
Hey we're going to leave this all behind us baby, wait and see
We're headed for a better life, you and me
We're going to break the chains that bind and, finally we'll be free
We're going to be the ones that have it all, you and me
Just hold on tight now baby

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I think I’m gonna leave
I’ll just have that one drink
And we’ve all gotta be up early
Boys, we oughta shut her down
Just take it to the house
‘Fore anybody starts getting crazy
I started walking across the floor
Before I got to the door

[Chorus]
Aw naw, somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron, hang on
I just might have to stay hey
Aw naw, look at the time y’all
What happened to coats on, long gone
I should be halfway home but aw naw

[Verse 2]
Yeah, girl I saw you come in
With all of your girlfriends
Just cutting up and shooting Bacardi
Yeah, I got my boys with me
We’re just blowing off steam
Not looking to pick up anybody
So, I was gonna walk on by
You turned around and we locked eyes

[Chorus]
Aw Naw, do you hear that song
Oh one that just came on, c’mon
DJ what you tryin’ to do
Aw Naw, it’ll be so wrong
If we didn’t dance one, show off
Those jeans you painted on
Aw naw, aw naw

[Bridge]
No, I didn’t mean to be here this long
And I tried to leave, so it ain’t my fault
No, I didn’t mean to be holding you
But, tell me, what was I supposed to do?

[Chorus]
Aw naw, somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron
Hang on, we’ve been here all night long
Aw Naw, it would be so wrong
If we didn’t dance one more song, show off
Those jeans you painted on, aw naw
Yeah, aw naw
Those jeans you painted on, aw naw[Chorus]
I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby

[Verse 1]
Little sun left to burn in the blue sky
Shinin' off the cross hangin' from the mirror of my ride
Breeze blowin' in, your hair blowin' round
You're scanning through the stations lookin' for that country sound
The good stuff iced up in the back seat
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be

[Chorus 2]
I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight, let's get to killin' it
Long as I'm rockin' with you girl
You know I'm cool with
Just chillin' it

[Verse 2]
Nothing but two lane country on up ahead
Girl you so fine, I wouldn't mind if this is all we did
You got me high on kisses
You got me missin' signs
Hard lookin' left when my world is on my right

[Chorus 2]
I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight, let's get to killin' it
Long as I'm rockin' with you girl
You know I'm cool with
Just chillin' it

[Bridge]
Nothing like a little you and me low key
Right now I'm right where I wanna be

[Chorus 2]
I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight, let's get to killin' it
Long as I'm rockin' with you girl
You know I'm cool with
Just chillin' it

[Outro]
Yeah I love rockin' with you and girl
We're just chillin' it[Verse 1]
Hey girl, you make me wanna write a song
Sit you down, I'll sing it to you all night long
I've had a melody in my head since she walked in here and knocked me dead
Yeah girl, you make me wanna write a song

[Chorus]
And it goes like ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms baby, all around you
And it goes like hey, girl, I'm blown away
Yeah, it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss
Yeah, it goes like this

[Verse 2]
Hey girl, you make me wanna drive you home
Get you outta here and get you all alone
I don't know what it is about you, baby
But I'm all messed up and it might sound crazy
But you make me wanna write a song

[Chorus]
And it goes like ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms baby, all around you
And it goes like hey, girl, I'm blown away
Yeah, it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss
Yeah, it goes like this

[Bridge]
Lookin' at you lookin' at me that way (Lookin' at me that way)
Makes me wanna grab my old guitar and play

[Chorus]
Something like ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on my heart, get you wrapped in my arms
Baby, all around you
And it goes like hey, girl, I'm blown away
Yeah, it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss
Yeah, it goes like this

[Outro]
And it goes like ooh, and it goes like hey
And it ends with a kiss
Yeah, it goes like this[Verse 1]
I still feel 25 most of the time
I still raise a little Cain with the boys
Honky Tonks and pretty women
But Lord I'm still right there with'em
Singing above the crowd and the noise

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like Jesse James
Still trying to make a name
Knowing nothing's gonna change what I am
I was a young troubador
When I wrote in on a song
And I'll be an old troubador when I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Well the truth about a mirror
Is that a damn old mirror
Don't really tell the whole truth
It don't show what's deep inside
Or read between the lines
And it's really no reflection of my youth

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I was a young troubador
When I wrote in on a song
And I'll be an old troubador when I'm gone
I'll be an old troubador when I'm gone[Intro]
American girls and American guys
We’ll always stand up and salute, we’ll always recognize
When we see Old Glory flying there’s a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

[Verse 1]
My daddy served in the army where he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard 'til the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free

[Verse 2]
Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly through our big black eye
Man, we lit up your world like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly man, it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Oh, brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

[Bridge]
Oh, justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
And you’ll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A
`Cause we`ll put a boot in your ass, it`s the American way

[Chorus]
Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly man, it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Of the red, white and blue
Oh, oh
Of my red, white, and blue

[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
The mixtapes got a little Hank, little Drake
A little somethin' bumpin', thumb thumpin' on the wheel right
The mix in our drinks, a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
Trucks jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah, you can find us where the party's at

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
This is how we roll, whoa, whoa
We hangin' 'round, singin' down everything on the radio
Whoa, whoa
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll, this is how we do
We're burning down the night, shootin' bullets at the moon, baby
This is how we roll, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2: Florida Georgia Line]
Yeah, baby, this is how we roll
We rollin' into town with nothin' else to do
We take another lap around
Yeah, holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me, yeah, you know we rollin' high
Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted, hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live, it might not be for you, but it's for me though
(Let's roll!)

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
This is how we roll, whoa, whoa
We hangin' 'round, singin' down everything on the radio
Whoa, whoa
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll, this is how we do
When the world turns ugly, I just turn and look at you, baby
This is how we roll, whoa

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Luke Bryan & Florida Georgie Line]
And we gonna sing it to 'em
Yeah, we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun
Yeah, we cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass it around and we dream about one day

[Chorus: Luke Byran & Florida Georgie Line]
'Cause this is how we roll... (Come on, yall)
We hangin' 'round, singin' out everything on the radio, whoa, whoa
(Get your hands up, get your hands up, get your hands up)
We light it up with our hands up (Aww, yeah)
This is how we roll, this is how we ride
We slangin' up the mud, cuttin' through the country side, baby
This is how we roll, whoa, whoa

[Outro: Florida Georgie Line & Luke Bryan]
Yeah, this is how we roll (This is how we roll)
(Yeah, baby, yeah, we'll be, lets go)
(Yeah, this is how we roll) This how we roll
This is how we do
We burnin' down the night, shootin' bullets at the moon
(Aww, yeah)
Baby, this is how we roll, whoa, whoa (BK, Tyler)
(One more time boys, let’s go)
Yeah, this is how we roll (This is how we roll, whoa, whoa)[Verse 1]
They wake up in the morning and they drink their coffee black
They love their woman one beat shy of a heart attack
On the way to work they might stop by a fishing hole
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they work, work, work, all week til the job gets done
Weekends they bar-b-que and have a cold one
They run on a big ol' heart and a pinch of Skoal
That's how country boys roll

[Chorus]
Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Casting their reels
Way back on them all county roads
Singing in bars
Souping their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and glove to them falling in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll

[Verse 2]
Well if you don't know your way around
They'll draw you a map
And if you're broke and you ask
They'll give you the shirt off their back
All they need is a little gas
A few dollars to fold
That's how country boys roll

[Chorus]
Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Casting their reels
Way back on them all county roads
Singing in bars
Souping their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and glove to them falling in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll

[Outro]
Aw come on now
Yeah they're crying aloud
Humble and proud
They love moma and Jesus and Jones
That's how country boys roll
Don't you know[Verse 1]
Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon light
A corner bar, and it just seemed right
So I pulled up

[Verse 2]
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
And he walked up, and said: "What'll it be?"
I said: "The good stuff"

[Verse 3]
He didn't reach around for the whiskey;
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said: "You can't find that here

[Chorus 1]
Because it's the first long kiss on a second date
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
Because your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff"

[Verse 4]
He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said: "I'll have some of that"
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends

[Verse 5]
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said: "That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed"

[Verse 6]
He said "Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
Because the one thing stronger than the whiskey

[Chorus 2]
Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff"

[Outro]
He said: "When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'
And look into those eyes, so deep in love
And drink it up
Because that's the good stuff
That's the good stuff"[Verse 1]
When you walked up behind me and covered my eyes
And whispered in my ear, guess who
I rattled off names like I really didn't know
But all along I knew it was you

And, the longer we talked, the more we laughed
And wondered why we didn't last
It had been a long time, but later last night
Baby, we caught up real fast

[Chorus]
And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
That's right
You look good in my shirt

[Verse 2]
Well now I'm not saying that we solved overnight
Every way that we went wrong
Oh, but what I'm seeing I'd sure love seeing
Every morning from now on

[Chorus]
And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

[Bridge]
Come on now
Aww, that's right
Oh, you look so fine
Eh, yeah

[Chorus]
And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
You look good in my shirt

[Outro]
One, two, three, four
You look good in my shirt
Yeah, yeah
(Come on, now)If there's a plane or a bus leaving Dallas
I hope you're on it
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it

Cause I swear out there ain't where you ought to be
So catch a ride, catch a cab
Don't you know I miss you bad
But don't you walk to me

Baby run, cut a path across the blue skies
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough

Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run

If you ain't got a suit case
Get a box or an old brown paper sack
And pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a Chevy
Baby just come back

There's a shortcut to the highway out of town
Why don't you take it
Don't let that speed limit slow you down
Go on and break it

Baby run
Oh baby run
Baby run[Verse 1]
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seein' that love in you
Is what I was tryin’ to do

[Verse 2]
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say (much to say)
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh

[Outro]
Not seeing that love in you
That’s what I was trying to do[Verse 1]
He gets up before the dawn
Packs a lunch and a thermos full of coffee
It's another day in the dusty haze
Those burnin' rays are wearin' down his body
The diesel's worth the price of gold
It's the cheapest grain he's ever sold
But he's still holdin' on

[Chorus]
He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says, "Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky"

[Verse 2]
That hail storm back in '83
Sure did take a toll on his family
But he stayed strong and carried on
Just like his Dad and Granddad did before him
On his knees every night
He prays, "Please let my crops and children grow"
'Cause that's all he is ever known

[Chorus]
He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says, "Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky"

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
And he takes the tractor another round. (Another round)
Another round (Another round), another round
And he takes the tractor another round, another round
He says, "I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please do not let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky"
"Underneath this Amarillo Sky"[Verse 1]
It don’t matter what plans I got, I can break ‘em
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I don’t mind telling all the guys “I can’t meet ‘em”
Hell, we can all go raise some hell any other night
Girl, I don’t care, oh, I just gotta see what you’re wearing
Your hair, is it pulled up or falling down?
Oh, I just have to see it now

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I will pour you a drink
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

[Verse 2]
Ain’t a spot downtown that’s rockin’ the way that you rock me
Ain’t a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do
I could be on the front row of the best show
And look down and see your face on my phone
And I’m gone so long, hang on. I’ll meet you in a minute or two

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I will pour you a drink
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

[Bridge]
If it’s two in the morning and you’re feeling lonely
And wondering what I’m doing

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I will pour you a drink
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime
Baby, you can crash my party anytime[Verse 1]
Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking?
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

[Chorus]
Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

[Verse 2]
By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking?
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

[Chorus]
Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

[Verse 3]
When a mountain of a man with a "born to kill" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-sliding like Bo Duke
What was I thinking?
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinking, oh what was I thinking
Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... cause I was

[Chorus]
Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking[Verse 1]
I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright

[Verse 2]
Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Verse 3]
It's been fifteen years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

[Verse 4]
Now I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doing alright

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Bridge]
Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm falling, desperately calling
Howlin' at the moon ah-ooh

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a fu man chu

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this goodSun coming up over New York City
School bus driver in a traffic jam
Starin' at the faces in her rearview mirror
Looking at the promise of the Promised Land
One kid dreams of fame and fortune
One kid helps pay the rent
One could end up going to prison
One just might be president

Only in America
Dreaming in red, white and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
We all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America

Sun going down on an LA freeway
Newlyweds in the back of a limousine
A welder's son and a banker's daughter
All they want is everything
She came out here to be an actress
He was the singer in a band
They just might go back to Oklahoma
And talk about the stars they could have been

Only in America
Dreaming in red, white and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
We all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America

Only in America
Where we dream in red, white and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
We all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America

Yeah only in America
Only in America
Where we dream in red, white and blue
Yeah we dream as big as we want to
Only in America[Verse 1: Alan Jackson]
The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow
An' so am I
Work day passes like molasses in wintertime
But it's July
I'm gettin' paid by the hour, an' older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call him somethin'
I think I'll just call it a day

[Chorus: Alan Jackson]
Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

[Verse 2: Alan Jackson]
Oh, this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon
An' half the night
Tomorrow mornin', I know there'll be hell to pay
Hey, but that's all right
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
Our Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone’s for me
You can tell 'em I just sailed away

[Chorus: Alan Jackson]
And pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

[Bridge: Alan Jackson, Jimmy Buffett, Both]
I could pay off my tab, pour myself in a cab
An' be back to work before two
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffett do?
Funny you should ask Alan I'd say
"Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care"
Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
He don't care
I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

[Outro: Alan Jackson & Jimmy Buffett]
What time zone am I on? What country am I in?
It doesn't matter, it's five o'clock somewhere
It's always on five in Margaritaville, come to think of it
Yeah, I heard that
You been there haven't you
Yessir
I seen your boat there
I've been to Margaritaville a few times
All right, that's good
Stumbled all the way back
Okay, just wanna make sure you can keep it between the navigational beacons
Ha ha ha, between the buoys, I tell you
All right. Well, it's five o'clock. Let's go somewhere
I'm ready, crank it up
Let's get out of here
I'm gone[Verse 1]
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Bridge]
And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

[Outro]
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now[Verse 1]
All we do right is make love
And we both know now that ain’t enough

[Chorus]
Ain’t gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Ain’t no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let’s do what we do best
I guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

[Verse 2]
Baby who we are just didn’t work
But maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt

[Chorus]
Ain’t gonna beg you to stay
Ain’t gotta ask you what’s wrong
Ain’t no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let’s do what we do best
I guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

[Chorus]
Ain’t gonna beg you to stay
Ain’t gotta ask you what’s wrong
Ain’t no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let’s do what we do best
I guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Let’s kiss tomorrow goodbye[Verse 1]
Couldn't wait to turn 16 and drive all the boys around
Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel was all I could think about
A little rust in the bed of that truck and a four speed on the floor
Five-hundred dollars it was mine, all mine and I never wanted nothing more

[Verse 2]
I took Katie down by the river with a six dollar bottle of wine
Just a fool trying' to play it cool hoping' she'd let me cross the line
I was praying that she couldn't tell I never been that far before
The first time's a one time feeling and I never wanted nothing more
No I never wanted nothing more..

[Chorus]
Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need

[Verse 3]
My buddies all tried to change my mind
But I told them that I'd thought it through
Katie laughed and my mama cried when they heard me say "I do"
Her little ring is a little thing, but its all I could afford
Now she's mine, all mine till the day I die, and I never wanted nothing more

[Chorus]
Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need

[Verse 4]
One Sunday I listened to the preacher and I knew he was preaching to me
I couldn't help it I walked up front and I got down on my knees
Right then and there, I swear I changed when I found the Lord
Glory Hallelujah, good God almighty I never wanted nothing more

[Chorus]
Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need

[Outro]
Never wanted nothing more
And I never wanted nothing more[Verse 1]
You got the gas
I got the matches
We gonna turn this town to ashes
Cause they ain't never seen nothing like us
Ain't heard loud till we turn it up
I got the wild
You got the crazy
You know that's why I love you baby
Cause your motor runs just as fast as mine
Pedal to the metal, keep your throttle down all night
And we only get one life

[Chorus]
Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here
Yeah, they're sure gonna know we were here

[Verse 2]
People talk girl
You know damn well
When they got a good tale to tell
Let's give them something they ain't never seen
A little Rated R redneck dream
Let's blaze a trail through the dirty south
Or give them something they can talk about
A little story that they won't forget
Long after we ride off into the sunset
Baby, cause we ain't dead yet, baby

[Chorus]
Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here

[Bridge]
We only get one chance around
This runaway roller coaster train
And it ain't slowing down
So baby they're gonna remember our name

[Chorus]
Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
No, we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here
Yeah, they're sure gonna know we were here[Verse 1]
I am not gonna lay around and whine and moan for somebody that done me wrong
Don't think for a minute that I am gonna sit around and sing some old sad song
I believe it's half full not a half empty glass
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last

[Chorus]
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moonshine
When I'm gone put it in stone "He left nothing behind"
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time

[Verse 2]
Folks are always dreaming about what they like to do but I like to do just what I like
I take the chance, dance the dance, it might be wrong but then again it might be right
There's no way of knowing what tomorrow brings
Life's too short to waste it I say bring on anything

[Chorus]
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moonshine
When I'm gone put it in stone "He left nothing behind"
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time[Verse 1]
He said, "I've been where you've been before
Down every hallway's a slamming door"
No way out, no one to come and save me
Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave me

[Verse 2]
Then somebody said what I'm saying to you
Opened my eyes and told me the truth
They said, "Just a little faith, it'll all get better"
So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm

[Pre-Chorus]
Changed
And now I'm stronger

[Chorus]
There must've been something in the water
Oh, there must've been something in the water

[Verse 3]
And well, I heard what he said and I went on my way
Didn't think about it for a couple of days
Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
I was all out of hope and all out of fight

[Verse 4]
Couldn't fight back the tears, so I fell on my knees
Saying, "God, if you're there, come and rescue me."
Felt love pouring down from above
Got washed in the water, washed in the blood and now I'm

[Pre-Chorus]
Changed
And now I'm stronger

[Chorus]
There must be something in the water
Oh, there must be something in the water

[Bridge]
And now I'm singing along to Amazing Grace
Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
Thank God almighty, I saw the light
Gonna look ahead, no turning back
Live every day, give it all that I have
Trust in someone bigger than me
Ever since the day that I believed I am changed
And now I'm stronger

[Chorus]
There must be something in the water (Amazing grace)
Oh, there must be something in the water (How sweet the sound)
Oh, there must be something in the water (That saved a wretch)
Oh, there must be something in the water (Like me)
Oh, yeah

[Outro]
(I once was lost)
I am changed
Stronger
(But now I'm found)
Was blind, but now I see[Verse 1]
Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

[Verse 2]
There's no hurry
Don't you worry
We can take our time
Come a little closer
Lets go over
What I had in mind

[Verse 1]
Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

[Verse 3]
Ain't nobody ever love nobody
The way that I love you
We're alone now
You don't know how
Long I've wanted to

[Verse 1]
Lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling that was quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man[Verse 1]
We say goodbye see you around
We turn our backs then turn back around
We break up we make up and we make love
We can’t seem to let go girl

[Chorus]
So I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over

[Verse 2]
I’m all alone, but you’re on my phone
Tellin' me you miss me and that you’re at home
Who knows what we are in the mornin'
All I know is I want you

[Chorus]
So I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over
Ooh, I’m comin' over

[Bridge]
Yeah we said that we’re done and I know that it’s late
But you already know, I’m on my way

[Chorus]
I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire that’s burnin'
I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over
I’m comin' over[Verse 1]
I got that real good, feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin' on 35's, pretty girl by my side
You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl hand me another beer, yeah!

[Chorus]
All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

[Verse 2]
Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country right hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain, might just make it rain
You can hang your t-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah!

[Chorus]
All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

[Bridge]
My kinda-- your kind-- is this kind of night
We dance in the dark and your lips land on mine
Oh oh oh oh oh, gonna get our love on
Oh oh oh oh oh, time to get our buzz on

[Chorus]
All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

[Outro]
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!
That’s my kind of night!
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!
Come on[Click here to read Blake’s story about working with Thomas Rhett on “All About Tonight”]

[Verse 1]
Don't bother telling me what I got coming in the morning
I already know
I got some feel-good pills and a red gatorade by my bed
Ready to go

I'm going to do my best to dance with every girl in this bar
Before they shut it down
Then I'll pay my tab climb in a cab
Heading to a spot downtown

[Chorus]
It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight

[Verse 2]
Hey pretty thing
I've been looking at you since the moment that you walked in
I got some wildest buddies that love spending money
And I see you brought a couple of friends

Just tell me your name
I don't need your number or a date next Saturday
Baby let's act like fools break a few rules
Party the night away

[Chorus]

Ha-ha slide

[Chorus]
It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
I said tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight

[Chorus]
Yeah it's all about tonight
Come on it's all about tonight
We're going to get our swerve on a buzz on
It's all about tonight
Come on baby I wouldn't worry about that
It's all about tonight[Chorus]
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 1]
Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin', man, y'all ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missing

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 2]
I sit back and think about them good ol' days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

[Chorus]
Chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride

Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
That's right[Verse 1]
My old man's that old man
Spent his life living off the land
Dirty hands and a clean soul
Breaks his heart seeing foreign cars
Filled with fuel that isn't ours
And wearing cotton we didn't grow

[Chorus]
He’s got the red, white, blue flying high on the farm
Semper fi tattooed on his left arm
Spends a little more at the store for a tag in the back that says U-S-A
Won’t buy nothing that he can't fix with WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America

[Verse 2]
His wife, she's that wife that decorates on the 4th of July
But says "every day's Independence Day"
She’s golden rule, teaches school
Some folks say it isn't cool, but she says the Pledge of Allegiance anyway

[Chorus]
Got the red, white, blue flying high on the farm
Semper fi tattooed on his left arm
Spends a little more at the store for a tag in the back that says U-S-A
Won’t buy nothing that he can't fix with WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America

[Bridge]
Born in the heartland, raised up a family
Of King James and Uncle Sam

[Chorus]
Got the red, white, blue flying high on the farm
Semper fi tattooed on his left arm
Spends a little more at the store for a tag in the back that says U-S-A
Won’t buy nothing that he can't fix with WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America

[Outro]
Made in America
Made in America

My old man's that old man
He’s made in America

America![Verse 1]
Well I just met you a couple hours ago
My last night in town, hey wouldn't you know
I get hooked on a girl with blue diamond eyes
Down here in Mexico, oh
Now you're walking up asking me to dance
Smiling that smile and reaching out your hand
Well there's a move or two, I'd like to show you
While I still got the chance

[Chorus]
Well you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh, why wouldn't I wanna stay?
Oh oh, and let that plane fly away, hey hey

[Chorus]
Cause you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
The beat of the music

[Verse 2]
I think I could get used to that steel drum playing
Waking up on a beach if you know what I'm saying
One more night would be more than alright with me
So hold on baby cause

[Chorus]
You got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
We're falling in love to the  beat of the music
To the  beat of the music[Verse 1]
Baby why don't we just turn that TV off?
Three hundred fifteen channels
Of nothing but bad news on
Well, it might be me, but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Guess the little bitty living room ain't going to look like much
When the lights go down and we move the couch
It's going to be more than enough
For my two left feet and our two hearts beating
Nobody's going to see us go crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

[Chorus]
Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?

[Verse 2]
Baby, why don't you go put your best dress on?
Those high heeled shoes you love to lose
As soon as the tunes come on
On second thought, just the way you are
Is already driving me crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

[Chorus]
Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?

[Outro]
Well it might be me but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Oh baby, why don't we just dance?[Verse 1]
Yes, she blew through the door like TNT
Put her hand on her hip, pointed a finger at me
Said: "I'm a whiskey drinking, cowboy chasing, helluva time
"I like Kenny, Keith, Allan and Patsy Cline
"I'm a full grown Queen Bee looking for honey
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."
Yeah, the band took a break
The DJ played P Diddy
She said: "I didn't come here to hear
"Something thumping from the city."
Said: "I, I shaved my legs, I paid my money
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play something country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."

[Chorus]
Crank up the band, play the steel guitar
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar
Threw back a shot; yelled: "I'm a George Strait junkie
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play something country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."

[Verse 2]
Yeah, the bartender yelled: "Y'all, it's closing time."
She got this wild look on her face
An' said: "Your truck or mine
"I know a place down the road
"It's kinda funky
"Ha-ooh-hoo, all out in the country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, now, play something country."

[Chorus]
Crank up the band, play the steel guitar
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar
Threw back a shot; yelled: "I'm a George Strait junkie
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play something country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."

[Chorus]
Crank up the band, play the steel guitar
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar
Threw back a shot; yelled: "I'm a George Strait junkie
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play something country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."[Verse 1]
Well, this heart of mine has been hardened like a stone
It might take some time to get back what is gone
But I'm moving on and you don't haunt my dreams
Like you did before
Oh, when I would curse your name
Hey!
Well I heard the news that you were back in town
Just passing through to claim your lost and found
But I'm over you and there ain't nothing there
That you could say or do to take what you did back

[Pre-Chorus]
Well you got nerve to waltz right in
And think what's mine is yours again

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been doing fine without you
Forgetting all the love we once knew
And girl, I ain't the one who slammed that door
But now you say you've changed your thinking
But I ain't got a heart for breaking
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
Oh, 'cause love don't live here anymore
Oh no

[Verse 2]
Well baby, you can try to tell me how it is
And try to justify everything you did
But honey, I'm no fool
Oh, and I've been down this road
Too many times with you
I think it's best you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I got one thing left to say
Is you can lay in the bed you've made

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been doing fine without you
Forgetting all the love we once knew
And girl, I ain't the one who slammed that door
Oh, should've known
Now you say you've changed your thinking
But I ain't got a heart for breaking
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
Oh, 'cause love don't live here anymore

[Bridge]
Oh no
That love don't live here anymore

[Outro]
Oh no, no
Sugar no, no
And you don't live here anymore
And love don't live here anymore
And since you walked out of my door
Love don't live here
Love don't live here, girl
Oh, love don't live here anymore[Verse 1]
My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?

Do you pour a little something on the rocks?
Slide down the hallway in your socks?
When you undress, do you leave a path?
Then sink to your nose in a bubble bath?

My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?

[Chorus]
I want to know
I want to know
I want to know

[Verse 2]
Do you break things when you get mad?
Eat a box of chocolates cause you're feeling bad?
Do you paint your toes cause you bite your nails?
Call up mamma when all else fails?

Who are you when I'm not around?
When the door is locked and the shades are down?
Do you listen to your music quietly?
And when it feels just right, are you thinking of me?

[Chorus]
I want to know
I want to know
I want to know

[Outro]
My oh my, you're so good-looking
But who are you when I'm not looking?[Intro]
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, Oh-ho

[Verse 1]
Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

[Chorus]
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

[Post-Chorus]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

[Verse 2]
And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

[Pre-Bridge]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

[Bridge]
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

[Chorus]
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls[Verse 1]
You ain’t got a dress that I don’t like
You ain’t got a pair of jeans that don’t fit you just right
There’s not a minute in the day
That you don’t knock me out, you don’t blow me away

[Pre-Chorus]
But, girl, now that the sun's gone down (whoa-oh-oh)
Looking at you right here and now, baby

[Chorus]
Somethin' about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue
I just gotta tell you, baby
Tonight looks good on you

[Verse 2]
I can taste the midnight on your lips
Makes me just wanna lean in for another kiss
Wind blowing your hair around
Girl, it makes me want to lay you down
You've been beautiful a million times
But I've never seen you look like this, no

[Chorus]
Somethin' about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue
I just gotta tell you, baby
Tonight looks good on you

[Bridge]
Looks so good on your skin
I don't ever, no, I never
I don't ever, ever want to end, baby

[Chorus]
Somethin' about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue
I just gotta tell you, baby
Tonight looks good on you

[Outro]
Tonight looks good on you
I just gotta tell you, baby

You look good at party
Good at the bar
Something bout underneath these stars

You look good at the house
Good in the car
You're looking so good anywhere you are

Tonight, tonight looks good on you
Tonight looks good on you
I just gotta tell you, baby[Verse 1:]
Well
I'm an eight-ball shooting double fisted drinking son-of-a-gun
I wear my jeans a little tight
Just to watch the little boys come undone

I'm here for the beer
And the ball-busting band
Gonna get a little crazy just because I can

[Chorus:]
You know I'm here for the party
And I ain't leaving till they throw me out
Gonna have a little fun gonna get me some
You know I'm here
I'm here for the party

[Verse 2:]
I may not be a ten
But the boys say I clean up good
And if I gave 'em half a chance for some rowdy romance
You know they would

I've been waiting all week just to have a good time
So bring on them cowboys
And their pick up lines

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:
Don't want no purple hooter shooter
Just some Jack on the rocks
Don't mind me if I start that trashy talk

[Repeat Chorus x2:][Verse 1]
She's a yellow pair of running shoes
A holey pair of jeans
She looks great in cheap sunglasses
She looks great in anything
She's I want a piece of chocolate
Take me to a movie
She's I can't find a thing to wear
Now and then she's moody

[Verse 2]
She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing
She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad
And she's a lover when she's loving

[Chorus]
And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
Cause she's everything to me

[Verse 3]
She's a Saturday out on the town
And a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck
And a cuss word cause it's Monday
She's a bubble bath and candles
Baby come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine
And she's feeling kinda tipsy

[Verse 4]
She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
And my unborn children's mother
She's the hand that I'm holding
When I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer
And she's the song that I'm playing

[Chorus]
And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
Cause she's everything to me

[Verse 5]
She's the voice I love to hear
Someday when I'm ninety
She's that wooden rocking chair
I want rocking right beside me
Everyday that passes
I only love her more
Yeah, she's the one
That I'd lay down my own life for

[Verse 6]
And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me
Yeah she's everything to me

[Outro]
Everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me[Verse 1]
Eighty-nine cents in the ash tray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade rolling in the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dog tags hangin’ from the rear view
Old Skoal can, and cowboy boots
And a Go Army shirt folded in the back

[Pre-Chorus]
This thing burns gas like crazy, but that’s alright
People got their ways of copin', oh, and I’ve got mine

[Chorus]
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain’s a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes
I drive your truck

[Verse 2]
I leave that radio playin'
That same ol' country station where ya left it
Yeah, man I crank it up
And you’d probably punch my arm right now
If you saw this tear rollin’ down on my face
Hey, man I’m tryin’ to be tough

[Pre-Chorus]
And momma asked me this mornin' if I’d been by your grave
But that flag and stone ain’t where I feel you anyway

[Chorus]
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain’s a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes
I drive your truck

[Bridge]
I’ve cussed, I’ve prayed, I’ve said goodbye
Shook my fist and asked God why
These days when I’m missin' you this much

[Chorus]
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain’s a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes (Brother, sometimes)
I drive your truck

[Outro]
I drive your truck
I drive your truck
I hope you don’t mind, I hope you don’t mind
I drive your truck[Verse 1: Charles, Hillary]
I run from hate
I run from prejudice
I run from pessimists
But I run too late
I run my life
Or is it running me?
Run from my past
I run too fast
Or too slow it seems

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
When lies become the truth
That's when I run to you

[Chorus: Both]
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts comin' undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you

[Verse 2: Both]
We run on fumes
Your life and mine
Like the sands of time
Slipping right on through

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And our love's the only truth
That's why I run to you

[Chorus: Both]
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts comin' undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you

[Bridge: Charles, Hillary]
Whoa, whoa
Oh, I run to you

[Chorus: Both]
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts comin' undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to

[Break: Charles, Hillary and Both ]
I run to you, I run to you, yeah
Whoa, whoa
Oh, I run to you
I run to you, girl
Whoa, whoa, mmm

[Outro]
I always run to you
Run to you
Run to you[Verse 1]
Red roadside wildflower if I'd only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter
Oh, at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through

Yellow sunset slowly dippin' down in the rearview
Oh, how she'd love to sit and watch you
I could have done that a whole lot more
If I hadn't been so stubborn, been so selfish
Thought about her more, thought about me less
Joked and make her laugh, held her when she cried
A little more that, maybe I

[Chorus]
Wouldn't be drivin' like hell flyin' like crazy down the highway
Callin' everyone we know stoppin' any place she might be
Goin' any place she might go beatin' on the dash
Screamin' out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeah maybe
She wouldn't be gone
She wouldn't be gone

[Verse 2]
She warned me it was comin' said if I didn't change
She was leavin'
I just didn't believe she would ever really walk out
God, I believe her now
Called her mamma, cried like a baby to her best friend
If they've seen her, they ain't sayin', they ain't sayin'
Now, I'm cursin' like a fool, prayin' it ain't too late
All I wanna do is fix my mistakes

[Chorus]
Find her beg her for one more try until then damn it I'll
Be drivin' like hell flyin' like crazy down the highway
Callin' everyone we know stoppin' any place she might be
Goin' any place she might go beatin' on the dash
Screamin' out her name at the windshield tears soakin' up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeah maybe
She wouldn't be gone

[Verse 3]
I wouldn't be beatin' on the dash
Screamin' out her name at the windshield tears soakin' up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeah maybe
She wouldn't be gone

Red roadside wildflower if I'd only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter, oh at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it throughOnce I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive

The way you talk, the way you tease
Right now I think you see
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me[Verse 1]
I've been thinking 'bout you all day, baby
Waiting on that sun to go down
Whatcha say I pick you up after work
Slide over, we slip out to the outskirts of town

[Verse 2]
I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
It’s supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like I’m going to have to hold you tight, yeah

[Chorus]
About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I hope it’s gonna be a long one
And if we’re lucky, it’s moving slow
I wouldn’t mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside
Let’s go

[Chorus]
About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train
Let’s go listen to the night train

About a mile off Old Mill Road
That spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train
Let’s go listen to the night train[Intro]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm changing lanes and talking on the phone
I'm driving way too fast
And the interstate's jammed with gunners like me
Afraid of coming in last
But somewhere in the race we run
We're coming undone

[Chorus]
Days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
As the cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start living right now
'Cause days go by, oh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Out on the roof just the other night
I watched the world flash by
Headlights, taillights running through a river of neon signs
But somewhere in the rush I felt
We're losing ourselves

[Chorus]
Days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
As the cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start living right now
And days go by, oh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, the days go by, oh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
We think about tomorrow, then it slips away
Oh, yes it does
We talk about forever but we've only got today

[Chorus]
And the days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window
As the cars go by
It's all we've been given
So you better start living
You better start living
Better start living right now

[Chorus]
'Cause days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
The cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start living right now
'Cause days go by, oh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, 'cause days go by, oh, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
Oh, so take them by the hand
They're yours and mine
Take them by the hand
And live your life
Take them by the hand
Don't let them all fly by
Come on, come on now
Yeah, come on, oh, ooh, ooh
Don't you know the days go by?[Verse 1]
I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name ‘til the neighbours called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don’t know what I did next, all I know I couldn’t stop

[Verse 2]
Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama’s phone started ringing off the hook
I can hear her now saying she ain’t gonna have it
Don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

[Verse 3]
Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame

[Verse 4]
Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

[Bridge]
Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart[Verse 1]
Work, work all week long
Punching that clock from dusk till dawn
Counting the days till Friday night
That's when all the conditions are right
For a good time
I need a good time

[Chorus]
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

[Verse 2]
I cashed my check, cleaned my truck
Put on my hat, forgot about work
Sun going down, head across town
Pick up my baby and turn it around
Good time
Ahh, I need a good time

[Chorus]
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

Pig in the ground, beer on ice
Just like ole Hank taught us about
Singing along, Bocephus songs
Rowdy friends, all night long
Good time
Lord, we're having a good time

[Chorus]
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time
Whew!

[Verse 4]
Heel toe, do-si-do
Scooting our boots, swinging doors
B & D, Kix and Dunn
Honking tonk heaven, Double shotgun
Good time
Lord, we're having a good time
Cause

[Chorus]
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

[Verse 5]
Shot of Tequila, beer on tap
Sweet southern woman set on my lap
G with an O, O with a D
T with an I and an M and an E
And a good time
Shhheww, good time

[Chorus]
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

[Bridge]
Ahh, turn it up now!
A shot of Tequila
Beer on tap
A good looking woman
To set on my lap
A G with an O, an O with a D
A T with an I an M with an E
That spells good time
A good time
Ohh

[Chorus]
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

[Verse 6]
Twelve o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock four
Five o'clock we know we're that's going to go
Closing the door, shutting them down
Head for that Waffle House way across town
Good time?
Ohh, we're having a good time
Ohh

[Chorus]
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

Ohh, yea, a good time
I need a good time
Yea, a good time[Intro]
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah girl, been diggin' on you
Sippin' on drink number two
Tryin' to come up with somethin' smooth
And waitin' on the right time to make my move
But I just can't wait no more
Can't let you slip out that door
Prettiest thing I ever seen before
Got me spinnin' around, I ain't even on the dance floor

[Chorus]
You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight (So tight)
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' that I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
Yeah, gotta get me some of that

[Verse 2]
Little more, what you doin' right there?
Swingin' your hips and slingin' your hair
Side to side with your drink in the air
Lord have mercy, now girl, I swear (I swear)
Gotta get your number in my phone
Gotta get me some of you alone (All alone)
We can worry 'bout it later on
Right now keep makin' this my favorite song

[Chorus]
You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight (So tight)
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' that I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
Some of that
Yeah, I gotta get me some of that

[Bridge]
In my ride, by my side, down the highway
In the dark, in my arms, in your driveway
All because of that smile you threw my way
Yeah, girl, you got a way of

[Chorus]
You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight (So tight)
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later

Well I caught my wife with another man
And it cost me ninety nine
On a prison farm in Georgia
Close to the Florida line
Well I'd been here for two long years
I finally made the warden my friend
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
Taking care of Ol' Red

Now Ol' Red he's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen
Got a nose that can smell a two-day trail
He's a four-legged trackin' machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that I've been here
Aren’t nobody got past Red

[Chorus]
And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

[Verse 2]
Well I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter
To my cousin up in Tennessee
Oh and he brought down a blue tick hound
She was pretty as she could be
Well they penned her up in the swampland
'Bout a mile just south of the gate
And I'd take Ol' Red for his evenin' run
I'd just drop him off and wait

[Chorus]
And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

[Verse 3]
Now Ol' Red got real used to seein'
His lady every night
And so I kept him away for three or four days
And waited till the time got right
Well I made my run with the evenin' sun
And I smiled when I heard them let Red out
Cause I was headed north to Tennessee
And Ol' Red was headed south

[Chorus]
And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

[Outro]
Now there's red-haired blue ticks all in the South
Love got me in here and love got me out[Intro]
Come on

[Verse 1]
Monday, hard to wake up
Fill my coffee cup, I'm out the door
Yeah, the freeway's standing still today
It's gonna make me late, and that's for sure

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm running out of gas and out of time
Never gonna make it there by nine

[Chorus]
There's gotta be something more
Gotta be more than this
I need a little less hard time
I need a little more bliss
I'm gonna take my chances
Taking a chance, I might
Find what I'm looking for
There's gotta be something more

[Verse 2]
Five years and there's no doubt
That I'm burnt out, I've had enough
So now boss man, here's my two weeks
I'll make it short and sweet, so listen up

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I could work my life away, but why? (Why?)
I got things to do before I die

[Chorus]
There's gotta be something more
Gotta be more than this
I need a little less hard time
I need a little more bliss
I'm gonna take my chances
Taking a chance, I might
Find what I'm looking for
There's gotta be something more

[Bridge]
Some believe in destiny, and some believe in fate
I believe that happiness is something we create
You best believe that I'm not gonna wait
Because there's gotta be something more

[Verse 3]
I get home, 7:30, the house is dirty, but it can wait
Yeah, 'cause right now, I need some downtime
To drink some red wine and celebrate
Yeah, Armageddon could be knocking at my door
But I ain't gonna answer, that's for sure
There's gotta be something

[Chorus]
Gotta be something more
Gotta be more than this
I need a little less hard time
I need a little more bliss
I'm gonna take my chances
Taking a chance, I might
Find what I'm looking for
Gotta be something more (Gotta be something)

[Outro]
Got to be, got to be, got to be more
(Gotta be more than this)[Verse 1]
Little boy, six years old
A little too used to being alone
Another new mom and dad
Another school, another house that will never be home
When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face

[Chorus]
This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is my temporary home

[Verse 2]
Young mom, on her own
She needs a little help, got nowhere to go
She's looking for a job, looking for a way out
'Cause a half-way house will never be a home
At night, she whispers to her baby girl
"Someday we'll find our place here in this world"

[Chorus]
This is our temporary home, it's not where we belong
Windows and rooms that we're passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where we're going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is our temporary home

[Verse 3]
Old man, hospital bed
The room is filled with people he loves
And he whispers, "Don't cry for me, I'll see you all someday"
He looks up and says, "I can see God's face"

[Chorus]
This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This was just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This was my temporary home

[Outro]
This is our temporary home[Verse 1]
You're not sure that you love me
But you're not sure enough to let me go
Baby, it ain't fair you know to just keep me hangin' 'round
You say you don't wanna hurt me, don't wanna see my tears
So why are you still standing here just watching me drown?

[Chorus]
And it's alright, yeah, I'll be fine
Don't worry 'bout this heart of mine
Just take your love and hit the road
There's nothing you can do or say
You're gonna break my heart anyway
So just leave the pieces when you go

[Verse 2]
Now you can drag out the heartache
Or baby, you could make it quick
Really get it over with and just let me move on
Don't concern yourself with this mess you've left for me
I can clean it up, you see, just as long as you're gone

[Chorus]
And it's alright, yeah, I'll be fine
Don't worry 'bout this heart of mine
Just take your love and hit the road
There's nothing you can do or say
You're gonna break my heart anyway
So just leave the pieces when you go

[Bridge]
You not making up your mind is killing me and wasting time
I need so much more than that
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


[Chorus]
And it's alright, yeah, I'll be fine
Don't worry 'bout this heart of mine
Just take your love and hit the road
There's nothing you can do or say
You're gonna break my heart anyway
So just leave the pieces when you go

[Outro]
Leave the pieces when you go
Oh yeah
Leave the pieces when you go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Leave the pieces when you go[Verse 1]
I work down at the pizza pit
And I drive an old Hyundai
I still live with my mom and dad
I'm 5'3 and overweight

[Verse 2]
I'm a Sci-Fi fanatic
Mild asthmatic
Never been to 2nd base
But there's a whole nother me
That you need to see
Go check out MySpace

[Verse 3]
Cause online I'm out in Hollywood
I'm 6'5 and I look damn good
I drive a Maserati
I'm a black belt in Karate
And I love a good glass of wine

[Chorus]
It turns girls on that I'm mysterious
I tell 'em I don't want nothing serious
Cause even on a slow day I can have a three way
Chat with two women at one time

I'm so much cooler online
So much cooler online

[Verse 4]
I get home, I kiss my mom
And she fixes me a snack
I head down to my basement bedroom
And fire up my Mac

[Verse 5]
In real life the only time I
Ever even been to L.A
Was when I got the chance with the marching band
To play tuba in the Rose Parade

[Verse 6]
Online I live in Malibu
I posed for Calvin Kline, I've been in GQ
I'm single and I'm rich
And I got a set of six pack abs that'll blow your mind

[Chorus]
It turns girls on that I'm mysterious
I tell 'em I don't want nothing serious
Cause even on a slow day I can have a three way
Chat with two women at one time

I'm so much cooler online
So much cooler online

[Verse 7]
When you got my kinda stats, it's hard to get a date
Let alone a real girlfriend
But I grow another foot
And I lose a bunch of weight everytime I log in

[Verse 8]
Online I'm out in Hollywood
I'm 6'5 and I look damn good
Even on a slow day, I can have a three way
Chat with two women at one time

[Verse 9]
I'm so much cooler online
Yeah I'm cooler online
I'm so much cooler online
Yeah I'm cooler online[Verse 1]
Been going round and round all day
Bailing some hay and stacking it all up
Can't wait for the sun to go down
Roll into town, shine the old truck up
Swing by the quick stop
Grab a couple Shiner Bock
Then ease on out your way
To your place around eight o'clock

[Chorus]
Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I want to take a little ride with you

[Verse 2]
I hope you are wearing those frayed out cut-offs
Makes me want to get lost out in the moonlight
Drop the tailgate down on a turn road
Watch the corn grow, baby that is a good night
Anyone from the heartland is going to understand
What I am talking about right now
Ain't no doubt, we got a game plan

[Chorus]
Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I want to take a little ride with you

Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, so you can play my radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I want to take a little ride with you
Take a little ride with you
I want to take a little ride with you[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "hello"
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "please don't go," and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: "Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'"

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you[Chorus 1]
Another summer day has come and gone away in Paris and Rome
But I want to go home
May be surrounded by a million people I, still feel all alone
I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know

[Verse 1]
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two, I'm fine baby, how are you
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat and you deserve more than that

[Chorus 2]
Another airplane, another sunny place, I'm lucky I know
But I want to go home, I've got to home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are, I want to come home

[Verse 2]
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside when everything was goin' right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
This was not your dream, but you always believed in me

[Chorus 3]
Another winter day has come and gone away in even Paris and Rome
And I want to go home, let me go home
And I'm surrounded by a million people I, still feel alone
And I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know

[Outro]
Let me go home
I've had my run, baby I'm done, I'm comin' back home
Let me go home
It'll all be alright, I'll be home tonight, I'm coming back home[Verse 1]
A full moon shining bright
Edge of the water; we were feeling alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side

[Chorus]
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night

[Verse 2]
Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and my ol' guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song

[Chorus]
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night

[Outro]
(Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night
(Whoa-oh)
A barefoot, blue jean night
(Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night
A barefoot, blue jean night
It's a barefoot, blue jean night
A barefoot, blue jean night[Verse 1]
I was always the crazy one
I broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the 50 yard line
You were always the perfect one
And the valedictorian so
Under your number I wrote "Call for a good time"
I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud

[Chorus]
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now
Now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy
Standing here today?
I couldn’t make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?

[Verse 2]
When I took off to Tennessee
I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money girl
Ain't it a cruel and funny world?
He took your dreams and tore them apart
He never comes home
And you’re always alone
And your kids hear you crying down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringing
Who could that be singing
Its me baby, with your wakeup call!

[Chorus]
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now
Now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy
Standing here today?
I couldn’t make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?

[Outro]
Tell me baby
I will preach onShe's a little complicated
She'll make her mind up just to change it
The kind of girl that keeps you waitin', waitin' around
She likes to get her toes done bright red
She's always reapplying her lipstick
The muddy river bank shes the first in and last out
She's got something I can't figure out
That everybody's talking about

Shes got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
She's sunny one minute then she's pouring down rain
And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
I want, I want I want whatever she's got
I want whatever she's got

Tell your mind before you thought it
What you thought your plan was park it
To figure out where your heart is so twisted up
Have you spendin' every weekend
And every penny you've been keepin'
Just to figure out what she's thinkin' when you're thinkin' it's love

Shes got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
She's sunny one minute then she's pouring down rain
And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
I want, I want I want whatever she's got
I want whatever she's got

She's got me hangin' on the ledge
On the edge of a kiss
All I ever wanna do is this

She got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
I want, I want, I want, I want, I want

[Chorus]
Shes got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
She's sunny one minute then she's pouring down rain
And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
I want, I want I want whatever she's got
I want whatever she's got

She's a little bit complicated
That's alright
Doesn't matter I'll keep on waiting
For whatever she's got
For whatever she's got


You can see it from the river
To the top of white pine ridge
Burning like a summer sun
A bunch of rednecks getting half lit
There's mud-covered trucks and suvs
Cranking out Hank and AC/DC

At the bonfire, out in the sticks
Country backwoods, homegrown hicks
Bonfire, dance a little jig
Hold up your cup and take another swig
Won't sleep til dawn, party right down to the wire
At the bonfire

Everybody sees the headlights
When old Sheriff John pulled up
We all got a little nervous
It's too late to hide our cups
He pops a top and hollers real loud
Dont worry yall i came to hang out

At the bonfire, out in the sticks
Country backwoods, homegrown hicks
Bonfire, dance a little jig
Hold up your cup and take another swig
Won't sleep til dawn, party right down to the wire
At the bonfire

You dont have to be from around here
To know right where to go
All you gotta do is load up
And head towards glow

At the bonfire, out in the sticks
Country backwoods, homegrown hicks
Bonfire, dance a little jig
Hold up your cup and take another swig
Won't sleep til dawn, party right down to the wire
At the bonfire

At the bonfire

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy
He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed

[Chorus]
And now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl

[Verse 2]
Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it, he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her
The coach said, "Hey, son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?"
And Daddy said, "You'll lose your free ride to college
Boy, you better tell her goodbye"

[Chorus]
But now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American

[Bridge]
And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said, "Be honest, tell me what you want"
And he said, "Honey, you oughta know
Sweet little, beautiful, one just like you
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American"

[Chorus]
Now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl

[Outro]
All-American girl[Click here to read about the first time Blake drank sangria]

[Verse 1]
You're crashin' into me like waves on the coast
Every time we talk, you move in close
I don't want you to stop, I don't want you to stop tonight
We've got the last two glasses on a straw hut bar
Tryin' to remember what number we are
String of white lights making your eyes shine tonight

[Chorus]
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria

[Verse 2]
Wreckin' ball dancin' down the hallway
You're holding your shoes, wearing my shades
We fall against the door, we fall into a wild warm kiss

[Chorus]
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria

[Bridge]
Only thing I want to do tonight
Is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around

[Chorus]
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Oh

[Outro]
Only thing I want to do tonight
Is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around[Verse 1]
They roll the sidewalks in this town, all up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here when midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain, I can't sleep with you on my brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired

[Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Verse 2]
Now all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for, I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold, nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
The DJ's on a roll

[Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Bridge]
The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon

[Chorus 2]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Outro]
Buzzin' like a streetlight
We can leave 'em on tonight[Verse 1]
Hammerin' a nail, stackin' them bales
I'm dog tired by the 5 o'clock hour
But I'm ready to raise some hell
And Jesse's gettin' ready, I'm gassin' up the Chevy
I'm gonna pick her up at six
I hope she's gonna wear the jeans with the tear
That her mama never fixed

[Chorus]
The moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah, that's how we do it 'round here

[Verse 2]
Mud on the grips, wild cherry on her lips
I've been workin' and tryin' and flirtin' and dyin'
For an all night kinda kiss
And country on the boombox, candles on the tool box
I'm doin' everything right, got the country boy charm
Turned all the way on tonight

[Chorus]
Yeah, the moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright, Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah, that's how we do it 'round here

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Yeah, the moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright, Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah, that's how we do it 'round here (Come on)

[Outro]
Yeah, that's how we do it round here
Yeah, that's how we do it round here[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Outro]
And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly[Verse 1]
A lot of people called it prison when I was growin' up
But these are my roots and this is what I love
'Cause everybody knows me and I know them
And I believe that's the way we were supposed to live
I wouldn't trade one single day here in small town USA

[Chorus]
Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
A little Hank Jr. and a six-pack of light
Old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday mornin' that's full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA

[Verse 2]
Around here we break our backs just to earn a buck
We never get ahead but we have enough
I watch people leave and then come right back
I never wanted any part of that
I'm proud to say that I love this place
Good ole small town USA

[Chorus]
Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
David Allen Coe and a six pack of light
Old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday mornin' that full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
I wouldn't trade one single day
I'm proud to say I love this place

[Chorus]
Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
Sweet Home Alabama and a six-pack of light
Old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday mornin' that full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Yeah I'll be okay
Here in small town USA
Oh yeah small town USA[Verse 1]
Driving through town
Just my boy and me
With a happy meal in his booster seat
Knowing that he couldn't have the toy
'Till his nuggets were gone
A green traffic light turned straight to red
I hit my brakes and mumbled under my breath
His fries went a-flying and his orange drink covered his lap
Well then my four year old said a four letter word
That started with "S" and I was concerned
So I said, "Son now where did you learn to talk like that?"

[Chorus]
He said "I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool?
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We got cowboy boots and camo pants
Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad?
I wanna do everything you do
So I've been watching you"

[Verse 2]
We got back home and I went to the barn
I bowed my head and I prayed real hard
Said, "Lord please help me help my stupid self"
Then this side of bedtime later that night
Turning on my son's Scooby Doo nightlight
He crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees
He closed his little eyes, folded his little hands
And spoke to God like he was talking to a friend
And I said, "Son now where'd you learn to pray like that?"

[Chorus]
He said "I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool?
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We like fixing things and holding mama's hand
Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad?
I wanna do everything you do
So I've been watching you"

[Bridge]
With tears in my eyes I wrapped him in a hug
Said, "My little bear is growing up"
He said, "But when I'm big I'll still know what to do"

[Chorus]
Cause I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool?
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
By then I'll be as strong as superman
We'll be just alike, hey won't we dad?
When I can do everything you do
Cause I've been watching you[Verse 1]
Staring out into the wild blue yonder
So many thoughts to sit and ponder
'Bout life and love and lack of
And this emptiness in my heart
Too old to be wild and free still
Too young to be over the hill
Should try to grow up
But who knows where to start

[Chorus]
So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

[Verse 2]
Sun comes up and sun sinks down
And I seen them both in this tourist town
Up for days in a rage
Just trying to search my soul
From the answers and the reasons why
I'm at these crossroads in my life
And I really don't know
Which way to go

[Chorus]
So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

[Bridge]
Maybe I'll settle down, get married
Or stay single and stay free
Which road I travel
Is still a mystery to me

[Chorus]
So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

[Outro]
Down in Mexico[Verse 1]
I'm meetin' my buddies out on the lake
We're headed out to a special place we love
That just a few folks know
There's no signin' up, no monthly dues
Take your Johnson, your Mercury
Or your Evinrude an' fire it up
Meet us out at party cove
Come on in the water's fine
Just idle on over an' toss us a line

[Hook]
Bass-trackers, Bayliners and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side, there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs and tiki torches
Regular Joes rockin' the boat, that's us
The Redneck Yacht Club

[Verse 2]
Bermuda's, flip-flops and a tank-top tan
He popped his first top at 10 a.m., that's Bob
He's our president
We're checkin' out the girls on the upper deck
Rubbin' in the 15 SPF, it's hot
Everybody's jumpin' in
Later on when the sun goes down
We'll pull out the jar and that old guitar
An' pass 'em around

[Hook]
Bass-trackers, Bayliners and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side, there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs and tiki torches
Regular Joes rockin' the boat, that's us
The Redneck Yacht Club

[Bridge]
When the party's over and we're all alone
We'll be makin' waves in a no-wake zone

[Hook]
Bass-trackers, Bayliners and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side, there's five houseboat front porches

Regular Joes rockin' the boat, that's us

Early monday morning to friday at five
Man I work work work but I don't climb climb climb
Boss man can shove that over time up his can
All I wanna do is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus 1]
To fill it up or throw it down
I got a forty hour week worth of trouble to drown
No need to complicate it, I'm a simple man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Verse 2]
Yeah the parking lot is muddy, can't get to the door
I take my jacked up drop er down in 4x4
She'll down a long neck, warm up the band
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus 2]
To fill it up or throw it down
I'm about to tear a new one in this old town
5 4 3 2 1 I'll be your rocket man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Verse 3]
You make me want to go ouuh ouhhh when you dance like that
You got that little tattoo playing peaky boo on your back
If you want to impress me baby here's my plan
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus 3]
To fill it up or throw it down
When you drive me home take the long way around
You be my Lois Lane I'll be your Superman
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Verse 4]
My head monday morning as that alarm clock sings
It goes bang bang bang while it ring ring rings
Yeah I'm ready to roll if you wanna rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

Yeah I'm ready to roll
If you want to rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

Damn right I'm ready to roll
If you want to rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

Yeah I'm ready to roll
If you want to rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus 4]
To fill it up or throw it down
I got a little hangover still hanging around
Yeah that hair of a dog is saying hey there man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Outro]
Yea that hair of a dog is howling hey there man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
Haaaouuhhh Yeaaa[Verse 1]
Girl I finally got you up in the seat of my old truck
And I bet you're wonderin' what we're gonna do
We could hit the county line, hell we do that all the time
Tell you what if you don't mind, we could start with something new
Instead of waiting like we usually do

[Chorus]
It started with a goodnight kiss, my lips, your lips
Baby let's just keep gettin' there
It started with a long goodbye, get wrapped up tight
Let's spend all night right here
It started with a goodnight kiss

[Verse 2]
I know that you told all your friends we were meetin' up with them
I can call 'em all again and tell them we ain't coming
Let me find a little spot, let me throw this thing in park
Let me light that little spark that gets you going like you do
Just tell me that you want to

[Chorus]
It started with a goodnight kiss, my lips, your lips
Baby let's just keep gettin' there
It started with a long goodbye, get wrapped up tight
Let's spend all night right here
It started with a goodnight kiss
It started with a goodnight kiss

[Bridge]
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
It started with a goodnight kiss
My lips, your lips

[Chorus]
It started with a goodnight kiss, my lips, your lips
Baby let's just keep gettin' there
It started with a long goodbye, get wrapped up tight
Let's spend all night right here
It started with a goodnight kiss
It started with a goodnight kiss

[Outro]
I don't wanna wait, no I don't wanna wait[Verse 1]
Tell me, have you ever wanted someone so much it hurts?
Your lips keep trying to speak
But you just can't find the words
Well, I had this dream once
I held it in my head

[Verse 2]
She was the purest beauty
But not the common kind
She had a way about her
That made you feel alive
And for a moment
We made the world stand still

[Chorus]
Yeah, we owned the night

[Verse 3]
You had me dim the lights;
You danced just like a child
The wine spilled on your dress
And all you did was smile
Yeah, it was perfect
I hold it in my mind

[Chorus]
Yeah, we owned the night
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
When the summer rolls around
And the sun starts sinking down
I still remember you
Oh, I remember you
And I wonder where you are
Are you looking at those same stars again?
Do you remember when?

[Verse 4]
We woke under a blanket
All tangled up in skin
Not knowing in that moment
We'd never speak again
But it was perfect
I never will forget
When we owned the night

[Chorus]
Yeah, we owned the night
Yeah

[Outro]
Oh, whoa, oh
Oh, whoa, oh
Oh, whoa, oh
Oh, whoa, oh

[Verse 1]
I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

[Verse 2]
I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

[Bridge]
Yeah, you think I'm down and out, hidin' out, hell-bent crazy
But that ain't me, baby

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
But I'm a long way from broke down
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
Ask any ol' barstool

[Outro]
I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide[Verse 1]
We say goodbye see you around
We turn our backs then turn back around
We break up we make up and we make love
We can’t seem to let go girl

[Chorus]
So I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over

[Verse 2]
I’m all alone, but you’re on my phone
Tellin' me you miss me and that you’re at home
Who knows what we are in the mornin'
All I know is I want you

[Chorus]
So I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over
Ooh, I’m comin' over

[Bridge]
Yeah we said that we’re done and I know that it’s late
But you already know, I’m on my way

[Chorus]
I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire that’s burnin'
I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over
I’m comin' over[Verse 1]
Sometimes you gotta drink about somebody
But that ain't goin' bring 'em back
Sometimes you gotta cry and miss somebody
Yea, we've all felt like that
If it's something that you gotta get over, but you just can't get over

[Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you're wishing you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closin’ time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind

You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you’re goin’ through
‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you try to fix somebody
Just to find out they’ll never change
So you go out and meet somebody
That makes you feel the way you thought you’d never feel again

[Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you’re wishin’ you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closin’ time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind

You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you’re goin’ through
‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you
Yeah (Yeah)

[Bridge]
Oh, girl loses boy, the best remedy is
Girl meets boy, girl don’t make it harder than it has to be
Come and lay one on me
Hmm hmm
You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
Yeah I know what you’re goin’ through, I do

[Chorus]
So come on and kiss somebody
In the back of the cab or on the subway train
Come on and kiss somebody
On the midnight street in the summer rain
If you’re wishin’ you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closing time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind

You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you’re goin’ through
‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you
I wanna kiss somebody[Verse 1]
Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm

[Verse 2]
Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah
Mmm

[Bridge]
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace

[Chorus 2]
Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man
Mmm[Verse 1]
All the pretty girls said pick me up at eight
All the pretty girls said I'm going to L.A
All the pretty girls said I hate my hair
Talking to the mirror in their underwear

All the lost boys said I just got paid
All the lost boys said I wanna get laid
When the town goes blue and the lights blink red
All the lost boys do what all the pretty girls said

[Chorus]
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said

[Post-Chorus]
All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said

[Verse 2]
All the sheriffs said kid, you better slow down
All the preachers said it's the devil's playground
I wonder if they knew they were wasting their breath
All I ever heard was all the pretty girls said

[Chorus]
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said

[Post-Chorus]
All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said

[Bridge]
All the seventeens said I'm getting outta dodge
All the big dreams said I'm selling all I got
All the high rollers busy placing their bets
Me, I'm heading south cause all the pretty girls said

[Chorus]
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said

[Post-Chorus]
All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said

[Outro]
All the pretty girls said[Verse 1]
Why do you keep on staring?
That mirror, mirror, it ain't fair at all (Mmm, mm)
Dress sizes can't define
Don't let the world decide what's beautiful, no

[Pre-Chorus]
You won't make yourself a name if you follow the rules
History gets made when you're acting a fool
So don't hold it back and just run it
Show what you got and just own it
No, they can't tear you apart

[Chorus]
If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on

[Verse 2]
Don't follow anyone
March to the rhythm of a different drum (Mmm, mm)
Why do we analyze, break out, and criticize the crazy ones? Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You won't make yourself a name if you follow the rules
History gets made when you're acting a fool
So don't hold it back and just run it
Show what you got and just own it
No, they can't tear you apart, no

[Chorus]
If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on

[Bridge]
Put your hands up, show me that you're one of a kind
Put your hands up, let me hear your voice tonight
Oh

[Chorus]
If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on

[Outro]
Traveled on
Take the road less traveled on[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 1]
Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 2]
Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine[Verse 1]
This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic, don't it?
I'm right where I wanna be

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this

[Verse 2]
I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never
Had to even leave this room

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
Could be better than this

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this (heaven)
Could be better than this (heaven, heaven)

[Outro]
I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time[Verse 1]
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that "come get me" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Verse 2]
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV"
And she falls asleep

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Bridge]
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me[Intro]
I got it good, girl
'Cause I got myself a good girl
Yeah, you up and took my whole world
And made it so good, girl

[Verse 1]
You're an angel, you're a keeper
The kinda thing that you gotta lock down
I'm lovin' just livin'
Every minute since you came around
I was lost in the neon lights
'Til the day that you called me yours, yeah
And they say when you know you know
And I know one thing's for sure

[Chorus]
I got it good, girl
'Cause I got myself a good girl
Still can't believe I found you
Can't imagine life without you
I could take you home to mama
Take you to the church right down the street
Yeah, you up and took my whole world
And made it so good, girl
Aw, so good, baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
You know, sometimes, I dream
'Bout 55 years from now
Gonna still be you and me
Watchin' that sun goin' down
I'll still be stealin' your kisses (What else?)
I'll still be holdin' your hand (What else?)
I'll still look at you and I'll pinch myself
Good Lord, I'm a lucky man

[Chorus]
I got it good, girl
'Cause I got myself a good girl
Still can't believe I found you
Can't imagine life without you
I could take you home to mama
Take you to the church right down the street
Yeah, you up and took my whole world
And made it so good, girl
Aw, so good, baby

[Bridge]
I was lost in the neon lights
'Til the day that you called me yours, yeah
They say when you know you know
And I know one thing's for sure

[Chorus]
I got it good, girl
'Cause I got myself a good girl
Still can't believe I found you
Can't imagine life without you
I could take you home to mama
Take you to the church right down the street
Yeah, you up and took my whole world
And made it so good, girl
Aw, so good, baby (I got it good, girl)

[Outro]
('Cause I got myself a) Yeah, good girl
(Still can't believe I) I found you
Good Lord, I'm a lucky man
I could take you home to mama
Take you to the church right down the street
Yeah, you up and took my whole world
And made it so good, girl
Aw, so good, baby[Verse 1]
You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new

[Pre-Chorus]
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Verse 2]
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'

[Chorus]
And I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Bridge]
Yeah, baby, mmm
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
You standin' there in that dress
Girl, it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
Oh, I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Outro]
Oh, you know it, baby
Mmm[Verse 1]
I had a couple beers with one of my friends
​Told him just how our story ends
​Did all I could to try to make it work
​But you drug my heart through the Alabama dirt

[Verse 2]
​I've been at the house, climbin' them walls
​Checkin' that calendar, x'in days off
​Hit another bar, call another friend
​Throw a few down, tell the story again
​
[Chorus]
​Hey, hey, what can I say?
​I can just lie and say it's all okay
​Oh, oh, what can I do?
​Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
​But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
​No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
​
[Verse 3]
I'm finally gettin' out back into the world
​Life is good, I met me a girl
​She got a beautiful heart, eyes are blue
​I don't hardly ever think about you
​
[Chorus]
​Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh, oh, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to

[Bridge]
​Sometimes I find peace of mind in a bottle of wine
​Sometimes I break down and cry
​
[Chorus]
​Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh, oh, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
​Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh, oh, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
​No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
It don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to[Verse 1]
Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
It was all roses, drippin' in diamonds
Sippin' on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Takin' his last name

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 2]
Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And havin' dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always gettin' way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil livin' in his eyes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 3]
Jenny slipped somethin' in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
Standin' there in a black dress singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
What if this goes south, what if I mess you up?
You say what if I break your heart in two, then what?

[Pre-Chorus: Kane Brown]
Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Verse 2: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if the sky falls (Sky falls)
Or the sun stops burnin'?
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'
Or I could kiss you (You should kiss me)
What if you liked it? (Bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
Awe yeah
C'mon

[Bridge: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
Damn

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Outro: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
Away (Away)
What if?[Verse 1]
Sunday morning
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

[Chorus 2]
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

[Bridge]
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours[Verse 1]
Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Verse 3]
Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey hey mama rock me
Mama rock me
Mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
You can rock me
Rock me[Intro]
Oh, babe

[Verse 1]
Never thought I would be like this
Wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss
Sippin' ninety proof, talkin' to the moon
Countin' down the hours till its two AM
Never thought I would be like this

[Chorus]
But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you

[Verse 2]
I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe
From the smell of your hair on the pillow case
Even if I tried without you by my side
I'd be dreamin with my eyes open
I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe

[Chorus]
But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you, no
I can't sleep without you, no, no

[Bridge]
I bet that DJ'S playin' your song
And your carryin' on
Baby I love the thought of that long as I know I'm the one you're comin home to

[Chorus]
But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you

[Outro]
Yeah no matter how late, baby I'll be stayin up
I can't sleep without you, no
Can't sleep without you
I can't sleep without you
Never thought I would be like this
Just wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss[Verse 1]
Something like a strong wind is coming over me
Has got a hold of me, yeah
Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be
Really I shouldn't be

[Pre-Chorus]
One more call
It’s one more “What'cha doing right now?”
It’s one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
One more here we go again

[Chorus]
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I’m not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you’re a goner
And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer

[Verse 2]
So calm and so cool, yeah I try to be
Like it don’t bother me
The last time was the last time
Until I’m all alone and picking up the phone

[Pre-Chorus]
It's one more call
It’s one more “What'cha doing right now?”
It’s one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
It's one more here we go again

[Chorus]
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I’m not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you’re a goner
And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer

[Chorus]
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I’m not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you’re a goner
And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer

[Ending]
Stay a little longer
Wishing you could stay a little longer...[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
May we all get to grow up in a red, white, and blue little town
Get a won't-start, hand-me-down Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
'Cause you miss it too much

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
Hope you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up
And know that fifteen minutes of famous
Ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
We'll all be watching the TV the day that it comes

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line (Brian Kelley)]
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
'Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

[Verse 3: Both]
May we all do a little bit better than the first time
Learn a little something from the worst times
Get a little stronger from the hurt times
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one

[Outro]
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all (get to have a chance to ride the fast one)
May we all (walk away wiser when we crashed one)
May we all (keep hoping that the best one is the last one)
(yeah the last one)
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all[Verse 1]
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

[Verse 2]
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go

[Chorus]
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

[Verse 3]
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

[Verse 4]
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

[Chorus]
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh[Verse 1]
They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 2]
So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

[Chorus 2]
When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 3]
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen

[Outro]
We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me[Verse 1]
Like a rainy Sunday mornin'
Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs

[Bridge]
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Verse 2]
You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah, I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Bridge]
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
You make it easy[Verse 1]
I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I know that you've been wondering
Mmm, so here goes nothing

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Verse 2]
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
One of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm, it's time you hear em

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Bridge]
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout ya
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah, you had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
In case you didn't know[Verse 1]
I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd, oh
But I can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh whoa, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
What are we waiting on?

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

[Bridge]
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, with the
River rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
We're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh[Verse 1]
She grew up around here, on that southwest side
Where the corn grows, up to the roadside
Went to high school here, got that Panther pride
She'll be cheering them on every Friday night

[Verse 2]
She couldn't hide her beauty with a baseball cap
Couldn't help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 21
But she never forgot, where she came from

[Chorus]
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

[Verse 3]
Her mamma's mamma was born right here
And her roots run deeper than that old town square
She's a good girl, but she's not uptight
She can rise and shine and she can hang all night

[Chorus]
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
She's got an old soul, she's the salt of the earth
When she gives her love, she knows what it's worth
There's a lot of pretty girls out there to me
But there's nothing like the one right across the street

[Chorus]
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

[Outro]
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
Ooh, ooh[Verse 1]
The way your fingers fit in mine
It's five plus five, not rocket science
This day in time, that's hard to find, it's true
The road we're on ain't a traffic jam
It's a Sunday drive on a piece of land
It's paradise as long as I'm with you

[Chorus]
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

[Verse 2]
We used to live on Instagram
Worry 'bout who all gives a damn
'Bout where we've been and where we ended up
Then I met you and you met me
And all the rest is history
An epiphany that all we need is us

[Chorus]
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin', love, make a lot out of a little
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style, yeah
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin', love, make a lot out of a little
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be[Verse 1]
I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush, ain’t slowin’ down
I got it real bad, want everything she has
That smile and the midnight laugh she’s givin’ you now

[Chorus]
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then, you’d want me just as much
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush

[Verse 2]
I don’t get no sleep, I don’t get no peace
Thinkin’ about her under your bed sheets
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s pullin’ you in
Lord knows I’ve tried, I can’t get her off my mind

[Chorus]
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you

I'm a dirt road in the headlights
I'm a mama's boy, I'm a fist fight
Kinda county line, kinda cold beer
Little hat down, little John Deere
I kinda give a damn
I kinda don't care
You see that girl standing right there

[Chorus]
She loves a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
I'm turning it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me

[Verse 2]
She likes my T-shirt
She likes my old boots
Likes to slow dance to some old school
She'll take a full moon over those city nights
And I ain't scared to get all up in them bright lights
Yeah, I can smooth it out
I can stick it up
I guess that's why she can't get enough of

[Chorus]
A small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat

I ain't heard you laugh like that in a long time
I wonder if you stopped his world like you did mine just now
I see you sippin' white wine instead of whiskey
And does he want you to be just a little more city?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

[Chorus]
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (Baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (Crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up

[Verse 2]
He hasn't even looked your way since you walked in (Walked in)
But I can't help it that I can't take my eyes off of you
Your favorite song just came on and me and you were singing along (Singing along)
And he don't even know a single word

[Chorus]
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (Baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (Crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up
I'ma be the first to call baby

[Bridge]
Sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
Oh, if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up[Verse 1]
I retired my red lipstick 'cause you said you didn't like it
I didn't wear my high heel shoes
'Cause I couldn't be taller than you
I didn't wanna lose my friends, but now it's hard to even find them
It's what you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
I thought I'd miss you

[Chorus]
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
I miss me more
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

[Verse 2]
I put on my old records that I hid in the back of the closet
And I turn them up to ten
And then I played them all again
I found my independence
Can't believe I ever lost it
What you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you

[Chorus]
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

[Bridge]
I thought I'd miss you
I thought it hurt me
And I'd wanna kiss you
I thought I'd miss you

[Chorus]
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
And I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more
(I miss me more)
(I miss me more)
(I miss me more)[Verse 1]
Since you turned the tables on me
I've been steady and learnin' lonely
Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
I've been havin' a record year

[Verse 2]
I bet you thought before you left
I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
I'm havin' a record year

[Chorus]
Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year

[Verse 3]
Your leavin' left me goin' crazy
I'm countin' on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go 'round and 'round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you
I rediscovered  Red Headed Stranger
Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back, I owe you a beer
For my record year

[Chorus]
Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year
Yeah, I'm havin' a record year[Verse 1]
She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', "no way she ain't got one"
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "come here, boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Verse 2]
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

[Chorus 2]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is"
She was like, "come here boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Bridge]
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

[Chorus 3]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "come here boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Outro]
Yeah play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody play it again, play it again, play it again[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
That lit up, ringing, buzzing good for nothing phone in your hands
With directions to the party that's just started with that cover band
That old school radio station, let's just drive until it's faded
Girl, let's lose it, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby, I swear

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Verse 2]
Let's start with them Luccheses
Baby, kick 'em to the floorboard
Them bobby pins holdin' your hair up
Girl, you don't need 'em no more
That dress hangin' off your shoulder as you move a little closer
Yeah, let's lose it tonight
Yeah girl

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doin' to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Bridge]
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby I swear
Um

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Outro]
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it[Verse 1]
Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Verse 2]
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

[Chorus]
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Bridge]
Yeah, you hit me Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane[Verse 1]
I love hearing that shower turn on
Bet there's nothing but a towel on you
You sing along with some Timberlake bumping
But he ain't got nothing on you
I don't wanna hear the coffee pouring
A goodbye kiss, then locking the door yeah
Sounds like leaving you, oh

[Chorus]
It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

[Verse 2]
Love the sound of the thunder rolling
Makes you move a little closer to me
Girl I bet that your neighbors hate us
'Cause we could laugh all night and never sleep
We can worry 'bout the world in the morning
Light up a candle, lock the door
Wanna stay right here with you, yes I do

[Chorus]
It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

[Bridge]
Turn your radio on, baby turn down the lights
I ain't going nowhere, I'm all yours tonight

[Chorus]
It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound, and I love the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

[Outro]
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Yes I do (I like the sound, I like the sound of that)[Verse 1]
We got a pontoon boat with a Yamaha
People dressed like they're in Panama
Small town, spring break
Every weekend 'round this place
And there's a bunch of boys tryna catch the eyes
Of all the pretty girls that are walking by
And those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah
Tan lines and gas station cheap sunglasses
They're coming here from all around

[Chorus]
To get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound

[Verse 2]
Bo got a ticket in a no-wake zone
But Katie's the one that should take it slow
'Cause she's dancin' on the dock and it's only 2 o'clock
Yeah, the fish ain't bitin' 'cause the party's on
The old men are thinkin' 'bout goin' home
But those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah

[Chorus]
We're gonna get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah
Woo!

[Bridge]
Yeah, we got the rope swing swingin' like a chandelier
Little bit of heaven on the water ride here
Don't need much, just a couple of beers and you and me
Gotta love this time of year
Getting southbound, southbound

[Chorus]
So let's get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Let's get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah[Verse 1]
I'm jealous of the blue jeans that you're wearing
And the way they're holding you so tight
I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on staring
So lock the door and turn out the night

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself
To myself

[Verse 2]
I'm jealous of the song that you've been singing
And the way it's rolling off your lips
It might be selfish but I'm thinking
I don't need nothing between you
Leaning for another kiss, yeah

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah

[Bridge]
Girl, I want you in the worst way
Yeah, I want you in the worst way (Mmmm)

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else (No one else, baby)
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall (Paint the wall)
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark (Hide away in the dark)
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah[Verse 1]
Met a man wearin' a T-shirt, says "Virginia is for lovers"
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He said "All you're really given is the sunshine and your name"
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

[Verse 2]
Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

[Bridge]
Find out when you die the keys to heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got to

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along[Verse 1]
Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick, sitting in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye-to-eye, and heart-to-heart
But maybe I’m just getting old
Used to work, but now it don’t

[Verse 2]
A long gone drive
You know the kind where you take a turn
And you don’t know why
But it clears your mind, a surefire cure
I need something stronger
That’ll last a little longer

[Chorus]
I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song

[Verse 3]
I wish I didn’t know so much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now that magic rush
Feels like a trick that isn’t working
But I haven’t lost all hope yet
Yeah, it’s hurting, but it ain’t dead

[Chorus]
I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song

[Bridge]
Give me a sign or a rhyme or a reason
Just something that I can believe in

[Chorus]
I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song[Verse 1]
Baby what's on your mind
When you see me pull up in your drive?
Do you wanna go downtown?
Maybe have a little high dollar wine?
Do you wanna go out to the country?
And maybe blow all our money
On some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs
See if we can lucky?
Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on
In your beautiful mind
Baby don't be shy
And tell me now

[Chorus]
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?

[Post-Chorus]
Stay up 'til the sun
Howl at the moon
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna

[Verse 2]
Karaoke in the neon light?
Go to Vegas, stay up all night?
See if we can find a cheap flight
Little 7, come 11, baby, roll those dice
Do I make you feel pretty?
Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me?
Do you wanna roll with me
To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city?
Do you wanna take in a broadway show
Or maybe just lay low?
I gotta know now

[Chorus]
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?

[Bridge]
Do I make you turn into somebody else?
Do you feel like you can finally be yourself?
Baby, tell me now

[Chorus]
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Out in the middle of nowhere now
We can take it back downtown
You know I don't care now
Just wanna take you there now
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?

[Outro]
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Oh baby
Tell me do I make you wanna?
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna
Let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Baby
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go flyin' down a two lane road?
Find a limb to hang your clothes on?
Oh, babe, tell me
Do I make you wanna?[Verse 1]
I'm just flesh and bone, heart and soul
And I've earned a couple scars
I've let once in a lifetime kind of things slide right out of my arms
I've struck out, I've been knocked down
More times than I can count
But that don't matter now

[Chorus]
'Cause when you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect oh, 'cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you, with everything I've got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot

[Verse 2]
You saw a spark inside of me that no one else could find
Your good morning eyes, they get me high
Girl, you're always on my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause when you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect oh, 'cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you, with everything I've got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot

[Bridge]
When I saw you for the first time, I knew I'd found amazing grace
It's like angels singin' every time I hear your name
When you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you, I'm not the man I was before you

[Chorus]
When you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm better than I was before you
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect oh, God knows I'm not
But I'll love you with everything I've got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot

[Outro]
I'm gonna give you, I'll give you my best shot
I'm gonna give, I'm gonna give you, yeah
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, yeah
Whoa, yeah[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
That Sunday morning choir calling, church doors open wide
That hallelujah, shoot right through ya, make you feel alive
That key under the mat, you know right where it's at
It's waiting with the porch light on
Don't bother calling, no need for knocking, just come on home
Come on home, my love is

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me

[Verse 2: Nick Carter]
Loud as shotgun, angels singing with the radio
Praying with you every mile down any dead end road
You can tell me every secret that you been keeping
I'll hold it, lock and key
Up with you all night, holding you all night, I never leave
You better believe my love is

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me
You better believe it, you better believe it

[Bridge: AJ McLean]
Every step you take, I'll be as sure as your shadow
Every move you make, you know I'll follow you wherever you go
Baby, you know my love is

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally (unconditionally)
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me

[Outro: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God your mama, and me[Verse 1]
I am insensitive, I have a tendency to
Pay more attention to the things that I need
Sometimes I drink to much, sometimes I test your trust
Sometimes I don't know why you're staying with me

[Chorus]
I'm hard to love, hard to love,  no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good

[Verse 2]
I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning, full of grace and full of Jesus
I wish that I could be more like you

[Chorus]
I'm hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
Love me good

[Bridge]
Girl you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted
I'm just a man, I'm just a man

[Chorus]
Hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Good

[Outro]
You love me good[Verse 1]
Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

[Chorus]
I’m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Verse 2]
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

[Chorus]
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Bridge]
Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice

[Chorus]
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away, away, away
Yeah I'm still one number away[Verse 1]
Daddy got sober, Mama got his best friend
I've cut down crying to every other weekend
Thanks for asking how I've been
I've gotten too good at hiding it
With an "I'm okay", "things are great"
But the truth is
Yeah, the truth is

[Chorus]
I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright
For the first time, in a long time, I'm doin' fine
I'm doin' fine

[Verse 2]
Daddy signed the papers the day I turned 19
And Mama drove north to find a new beginning
I blamed God, I blamed myself
Then I found my knees and prayed like hell
It's funny how a touch of grace gives you healing
Yeah, I'm healing

[Chorus]
I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright
For the first time, in a long time, I'm doin' fine
I'm doin' fine, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
All these old pains
And I wish they'd go away
But I guess you can't be free without a fight

[Chorus]
I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright
Oh, for the first time, in a long, long time, I'm doin' fine
I'm doin' fine
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Daddy got sober, Mama got his best friend
But I'm doin' fine
Yeah, yeah[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at

[Pre-Chorus 1: Florida Georgia Line]
Who knows where this road is supposed to lead?
We got nothing, but time
As long as you're right here next to me, everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha]
I don't mean to be so uptight
But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gon' lie
'Cause I'm tired of the fake love
Show me what you're made of
Boy, make me believe

[Pre-Chorus 2: Florida Georgia Line]
Whoa, hold up girl, don't you know you're beautiful?
And it's easy to see

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line]
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Post-Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line]
So c'mon, ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes
So c'mon, ride with me, ride with me
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha, Florida Georgia Line, Both]
Maybe we do
Maybe we don't
Maybe we will
Maybe we won't

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha, Florida Georgia Line, Both]
But if it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be (Sing it, baby)
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be (C'mon)
Baby, just let it be (Let's go)
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes (Come for a ride)
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be (Yeah)

If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be[Verse 1]
You're on the couch, blowing up my phone
You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soiree
If you're in the mood, sit tight right where you are, babe

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you

[Chorus]
We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down

[Post-Chorus]
If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

[Verse 3]
Throw a neon t-shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shaking the floor, rattling the roof
We'll go to town right there in your living room

[Chorus]
Let's have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down

If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

We're gonna have a house party[Intro]
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
La-a-a-a-a-di-da

[Verse 1]
If I had a dollar every time that I swore you off
And a twenty every time that i picked up when you called
And a crisp new Benjamin for when you're here then gone again
And a dollar every time I was right about you after all

[Chorus]
Boy, I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky... Shit, I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da

[Verse 2]
If I had a dime every time that you crossed my mind
Well, I'd basically be sitting on a big ass pile of dimes
And all the times that you make my heart feel cheap
I might as well have won the lottery
All of this pain and me cursing your name
Would just turn into dollar signs

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky... Shit, I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da

[Bridge]
Told myself I wouldn't do this again
But how much you wanna bet I'mma do this again?

[Chorus]
Rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn

No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky... Shit, I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da

[Outro]
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was just hanging out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand
So I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye
Lke nothing I'd ever seen
Sunburned auburn air
The California dream
Yeah, she was shaking them hips
To some old motown song
I couldn't say anything
So I sang along

[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?

[Verse 2]
So I just hung around
This little west coast town
I dropped by every night
I stayed till closing time
My little mystery
That girl is killing me
So I put on a song
Just to sing along

[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinking about
All I think about, think about, think about

[Bridge]
So I'm right here right now
Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know

[Chorus]
You were a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, you're moving through my mind
I gotta know your name and I gotta see you again
And if you're listening, listening, listening
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Girl, I'm hanging around this little town
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?[Verse 1]
I've been thinking 'bout you all day, baby
Waiting on that sun to go down
Whatcha say I pick you up after work
Slide over, we slip out to the outskirts of town

[Verse 2]
I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
It’s supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like I’m going to have to hold you tight, yeah

[Chorus]
About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I hope it’s gonna be a long one
And if we’re lucky, it’s moving slow
I wouldn’t mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside
Let’s go

[Chorus]
About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train
Let’s go listen to the night train

About a mile off Old Mill Road
That spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train
Let’s go listen to the night train[Verse 1]
The scent that you left on my pillow
The sound of your heartbeat with mine
The look in your eyes like a window
The taste of your kiss soaked in wine

[Chorus]
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing

[Verse 2]
Guess you forgot what you told me
Because you left my heart on the floor
Baby, your ghost still haunts me
But I don't want to sleep with him no more

[Chorus]
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing

[Bridge]
They say time is the only healer
God, I hope that isn't right
Cause right now I'd die to not remember

[Chorus]
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
I'm haunted by the memories of
Every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Every little thing[Verse 1]
Turn me on turn me off then you turn me back on by the weekend
And you won’t say the words that I want but you flirt when you’re drinkin’
I see those bubbles pop up like you’re texting then they disappear
Lets cut through the shit then let’s get to what we’re doing here

[Chorus]
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama
Put my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama
Your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf
I'm asking you baby 'cause i’m tired of asking myself

[Chorus]
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing, are we dancing in the kitchen, baby tell me what it is or what it isn't
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand

[Outro]
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number I should wash right off my hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand[Verse 1]
It was the 14th of October
Had that t-shirt off your shoulder
I was drunk, said I was sober
And you said yeah right
We were talkin’ for a minute
Then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game

[Chorus 1]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Verse 2]
We were dancin’, we were buzzin’
Takin’ shots like it was nothin’
Did the runnin’ man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you
You probably didn’t think that it was true

[Chorus 2]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Bridge]
Oh, that night was just like you, baby
I can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin’
And it feels just like it was last weekend
That we jumped in
Right off the deep end

[Chorus 2]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Outro]
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable[Verse 1]
Man, this shit's unflatterin', all up in my head again
I don't feel myself right now, maybe I should just lay down
If vanity's my vitamin, well, I don't feel the difference
I don't like myself right now, gotta find a way out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What you feel is natural
But I don't wanna feel this anymore
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor
What you waitin' for?

[Chorus 1]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl

[Verse 2]
Draw your comparisons, tryin' to find who's lesser than
I don't wanna wear your crown, there's enough to go around

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What you feel is natural (Natural)
You don't gotta put up with this anymore (Anymore)
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor (Oh)
Tell me what you waitin' for?

[Chorus 1]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl

[Bridge]
Girl, don't hang your head low
Don't lose your halo, don't lose your halo
Girl, don't hang your head low
Don't lose your halo, oh

[Chorus 2]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl, won't you stop your cryin'? (Won't you stop your cryin'?)
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay (Everything's gonna be okay)
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay (Everyone's gonna be okay)
Baby girl

[Outro]
Everyone's gonna okay, baby
Mm mm mm, mm mm mm
Hoo hoo hoo, hoo[Verse 1]
Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Verse 2]
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Bridge]
We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Outro]
I'ma take it slow
Just as fast as I can (Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed)
Got braids in her hair (I know every curve like the back of my hand)[Intro]
Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya

[Verse 1]
Wheels rolling on an old Toyota
Twist top on a Sunkist soda
Your brown hair in the west coast wind
If heaven is anywhere
90’s hits at the top of our lungs
Shuffle landed on "Still the One"
Missing turns 'cause that's our song
If heaven is anywhere

[Chorus]
It's in a blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here
Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya

[Verse 2]
Red sun melting to the blacktop
Dollar shades from a nowhere truck stop
Your kiss and that coastline
If heaven is anywhere
Pull it over to the shoulder
To take it in
And pull you closer
Loving you longer than I ever did
Going places we never been
'Cause heaven's in

[Chorus]
A blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here

Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya
If heaven is anywhere

[Chorus]
It's in a blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here

Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
Rays of gold are shining on ya

8 o’clock on Friday night I’m still at home
All my girls just keep on blowin' up my phone
Sayin', "Come on, he ain’t worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name"
Now there’s only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

[Chorus]
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

[Verse 2]
Tonight I’ll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I’ll let him down easy
'Cause tonight it’s all about dancin' with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

[Chorus]
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

[Bridge]
I’m feelin' that buzz
I’m ready to rock
Ain’t no way I’m gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I’m comin' in hot
Hey bartender
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Hey Bartender
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender
Hey bartender[Verse 1]
I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor
Act like we never met before for fun

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one I want
You're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king
Ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you

[Verse 2]
The way you sparkle like a diamond ring
Maybe one day we can make it a thing
Test time and grow old together
Rock in our chairs and talk about the weather, yeah
So, bring it on in for that angel kiss
Put that feel good on my lips, cause

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one I want
You're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king
Ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm here to pick you up
And I hope I don't let you down, no

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one I want
You're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king
Ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one I want
You're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king
Ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you

[Outro]
I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor[Verse 1]
Would've thought you wrote down every word
Goodbye spelled out like it had been rehearsed
There ain't no point in trying to change your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems like
You've got it all figured out
You're alright
With the way this is going down

[Chorus]
Don't tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

[Verse 2]
By the way you're talking you would think
You never had any real feelings for me
And if you think I can look across the bar

[Pre-Chorus]
And see you
In someone else's arms
And I need you
Oh who do you think you are?

[Chorus]
Trying to tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

[Bridge]
You always told me
You'd never leave me
You said I was your one and only
So what makes you think I wanna hear you say
We can still be friends
No, I don't wanna be friends
Stop telling me, stop telling me, woah

[Chorus]
That we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
You really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you[Verse 1]
Quarter in a payphone
Drying laundry on the line
Watching Sun Tea in the window
Pocket watch tellin time
Seems like only yesterday I'd get a blank cassette
Record the country countdown cause I couldn't buy it yet
If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be
I learned to drive that 55 just like a queen, three on a tree

[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

[Verse 2]
If you had something to say
You'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you'd put a stamp on it
And they'd get it three days later
Boys would call the girls
And girls would turn them down
Staying married was the only way to work your problems out

[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

[Post-Chorus]
Automatic

[Bridge]
Let's pull the windows down
Windows with the cranks
Come on let's take a picture
The kind you gotta shake

[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

[Verse 1]
Lights go down, wheels go 'round
I'm taking you home
Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now
I'm not ready to shut it down
The way the dashboard glow
Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind
And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot
Stop this car and throw it in park and just

[Chorus]
Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot
(Slow dance in a parking lot)

[Verse 2]
A half song gone, one door open, across the lot
A rent-a-cop's rolling a security car
Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time
To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks
You start humming the very last verse to "She's Every Woman"
And I don't care what song comes next
I'm falling right here, don't want a safety net in a

[Chorus]
Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot

[Post-Chorus]
And get close to you
Making the most of whatever we got, even if it's just

[Chorus]
A slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot[Verse 1]
You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new

[Pre-Chorus]
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Verse 2]
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'

[Chorus]
And I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Bridge]
Yeah, baby, mmm
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
You standin' there in that dress
Girl, it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
Oh, I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Outro]
Oh, you know it, baby
Mmm[Verse 1]
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that "come get me" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Verse 2]
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV"
And she falls asleep

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Bridge]
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me[Verse 1]
She got that "hey y'all" little southern drawl that she got from her mama
Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter what we're listening to
Spinning her around the living room
And I fall apart every time

[Chorus]
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Yes, she does

[Verse 2]
She's got her feet on the dash
Hair blowing back, hand out the window
Making up half the words that she's singing
And she takes an hour to pick a  movie out
Five minutes in and she's passing out
And I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd stay there forever if I could
Doing nothing never felt so good
And I wish that I could stop time

[Chorus]
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Oh, yes she does
And I don't wanna think about where I would be without her, oh
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes, whoa
Yeah, my dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life

[Outro]
Oh, she does
Back to life[Verse 1]
Water towers are made for hearts and names
Friday nights are made for football games
Fallin' leaves are made for fallin' in
Front porch steps are made for goodnight kissin'
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

[Verse 2]
Summer jobs are made for spendin' cash
Second dates are made for goin' fast
Early curfews are made for sneakin' past
2 a.m. was made for pissed off dads
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

[Chorus]
Like a ship without a sea
Or a song without a melody
I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do
'Cause I was made for you

[Verse 3]
Smoky bars are made for "How 'bout a dance?"
Open roads are made for holdin' hands and
Laid back seats are made for young love
Two pink lines are made for growin' up
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you

[Chorus]
Like a ship without a sea
Or a song without a melody
I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do
'Cause I was made for you

[Verse 4]
Tiny shoes are made for tiny feet
My two arms are made for where you sleep
Sky was made for the moon and stars
You were made to steal my heart
And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you[Verse 1]
We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down a coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes
Come to think, I miss them all
And damn, babe, it's all your fault

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Verse 2]
Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God, I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my)
Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Bridge]
Don't you remember Times Square?
And people counting down everywhere
2000-whatever, no, I didn't care
'Cause baby you were there
And once again, couldn't help but stare

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah, you guessed it, girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you

[Outro]
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you[Verse 1]
Girl, I’ve always loved you, but something’s changed
Blame it on time, the road or the ride, but it ain’t the same
It’s a different kind of feeling, not the one I knew
From the sweet on your lips, to how your hand in mine fits
Girl I’ve always loved you but

[Chorus]
I don’t love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It’s stronger the longer I’m with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn’t know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby I do, I don’t love you like I used to, no

[Verse 2]
What we got ain’t got no ending, like a band of solid gold
It’s sweeter with time like strawberry wine, it gets as good as it gets old
And oh, we thought we knew what it meant back then
But I keep fallin' all in higher than I’ve ever been, oh no, oh

[Chorus]
I don’t love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It’s stronger the longer I’m with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn’t know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby I do, I don’t love you like I used to, no

[Break]
Oh no
Oh no, no-no

[Chorus]
I don’t love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It’s stronger the longer I’m with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn’t know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby I do, I don’t love you like I used to, no

[Outro]
Oh, oh
I don’t love you like I used to
Oh, oh, no
Love you like I used to
Love you like I used to, yeah
Oh, I don’t love you like I used to[Verse 1: Jordan, Jordan & Chad]
Sometimes I think this world's too much
All the hurt, all the hate, all it takes is a human touch
It's so easy to get lost in the light
Make a change, make a choice, all the noise, we can drown it out

[Chorus: Jordan, Chad & Simon, Chad]
Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two

[Verse 2: Simon, Simon & Chad]
Kiss me like there's no one else for miles
Take it fast, take it slow, letting go for a little while
Heaven's so close to the both of us
For the rest of the night we can fly, we can rise above

[Chorus: Jordan, Chad & Simon, Chad, (Jordan)]
Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two (Oh)

[Bridge: Jordan, Simon, Chad & (All)]
Girl, for you (I'd build a world)
For two (I'd build a world)
Girl, for you (I'd build a world)
For two, yeah

[Chorus: Jordan, Chad & Simon, Chad]
Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two[Verse 1]
We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long til I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Outro]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Still chasing you, still chasing you[Verse 1]
How can someone stand so damn close
And feel like they're worlds away?
I can see your sad story eyes
So how do you have no words to say?
All I want is to fall in deeper
Than I've ever been
Why won't you let me?
I can handle your heart, so help me

[Chorus]
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashin' in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you

[Verse 2]
Like a lighthouse I've been shinin' bright
Through the dark for the both of us
And "I've done it outta love" is not enough
But God, how I wish it was
And I don't wanna find out
How much lonely I can take before you lose me
Baby, look at me and swear you won't lose me

[Chorus]
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashin' in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you

[Bridge]
I can't let it go
From moments in your arms
But they come back again
The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves
The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves

[Chorus]
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashin' in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you[Intro]
Mhm, mhm, mhm
Mhm, mhm, mhm

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of sleeping on us
I'm over dodging this crush
I'm sick of waiting 10 minutes just text you back
So you don't get to thinking that I'm too attached
I'm more than benefit friends
I'm more than just a weekend binge
I want you to be my hottie riding shotty
I don't want nobody's body but your body, babe
All I'm trying to say is

[Chorus 1]
There's a difference between “Miss you” and “I miss your face”
There's a difference in “What's going on?” and “Baby how was your day?”
Yeah, there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two
There's a difference in “Love ya” and “I love you”
And I wanna be the difference
Yeah I do

[Verse 2]
I wanna be the difference between “Hey what's up?” and “What we gonna do tonight?”
Between yeah she's cool we hang out sometimes and that girl right there she's mine
Between leading you on and holding your hand
Sitting it out and girl let's dance
Between playing it safe and taking a chance
Yeah pumping the brakes or hitting the gas

[Chorus 2]
There's a difference between “Miss you” and “I miss your face”
There's a difference in “What's going on?” and “Baby how was your day?”
Yeah, there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two
There's a difference in “Love ya” and “I love you”
And I wanna be the difference

[Bridge]
Close the distance
And be that puzzle piece you didn't even know you was missing babe
Oh I wanna be the difference
Yeah I do

[Chorus 3]
There's a difference between “Miss you” and “I miss your face”
There's a difference in  “What's going on?” and “Baby how was your day?”
Yeah there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two
There's a difference in “Love ya” and “I love you”
And I wanna be the difference I am
Well I wanna be the difference
I wanna be the difference[Verse 1]
I don't know who we'll be in a couple years
But  I don't wanna think a second past this minute
Cuz'  you're here, in it
I don't know how you could make me so confused
And so sure at the same time
Half  a sentence and I guess the rest
How  are you in my head
How is this night so perfect
I  don't know how this ends
I'm just bein' honest

[Chorus]
I will always be in love with who you are
Right here, right now, with me tonight (ohhh)
And  I will always see you like this, reckless, fearless
You're tellin' me for the first time
I'm always gonna love you
Hey-ya, Hey-ey-ey-ya

[Verse 2]
I look at you and laugh, cuz you're cover's blown
And we both know what this change is
No going back, we both know that
This is our time and I'm hiding at how scared I am that
You won't always be mine but whatever happens

[Chorus]
I will always be in love with who you are
Right here, right now, with me tonight (ohhh)
And I will always see you like this, reckless, fearless
You're tellin' me for the first time
I'm always gonna love you (I'm always gonna love you)
Hey-ya, Hey-ey-ey-ya

I will always be in love with who you are tonight (ohhh)
I will always be in love with who you are
Right here, right now, with me tonight (ohhh)
And I will always see you like this, reckless, fearless
You're tellin' me for the first time
I'm always gonna love you
Hey-ya, Hey-ey-ey-ya[Verse 1]
Lights are down, but you're shining like you always do
Every day, I'm reminded of the miracle of you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're too good for coincidence
And too perfect for an accident
And I'm not sure where Heaven is
But every night, I get a glimpse

[Chorus]
And I know I'm blessed
Watching you spin in that dress
Making my heart beat out my chest
I can't count the times I've heard
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm blessed
And all I ain't got is my breath
You stole it the first time we meet
You're more than I deserve
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm

[Verse 2]
I keep checking you for halos
Swear you're an angel in disguise
You poke my mind from every angle, and I
I can see Heaven in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You're too good for coincidence
And too perfect for an accident
And I'm not sure where Heaven is
But every night, I get a glimpse

[Chorus]
And I know I'm blessed (Blessed)
Watching you spin in that dress (Dress)
Making my heart beat out my chest
I can't count the times I've heard
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed)
And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath)
You stole it the first time we met
You're more than I deserve
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm

[Bridge]
Baby, you're the kind of girl that I've always prayed for
And I swear by my dying breath that I will be faithful
Oh, baby
'Cause I'm on my knees (I'm on my knees)
Whoa, you make me believe

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm blessed (Blessed)
Watching you spin in that dress (Dress)
Making my heart beat out my chest
I can't count the times I've heard
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed)
And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath)
You stole it the first time we met
You're more than I deserve
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm blessed3/1

Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, love suicide is killing me
You're getting into my head, you're like a guillotine
You've got my gasping for air in your vicinity
And now your saying some things that you don't really mean
That's really mean, how the hell I'm caught up in between?
Devil's advocate trying not to intervene
Putting up a front like it ain't a thing to me
I swear this gotta be the worst position to be in, be in
I guess you feel like you've been ignored
And your perfect picture turn into a jigsaw
'Cause when your round me you get a little withdrawn
And we just can't seem to find time to sit and talk
I know she isn't sure, uh

[Refrain: Tinie Tempah]
What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house
And everything becomes so cold?
Baby, that's the only thing I wanna know

[Chorus 1: Ester Dean (Tinie Tempah)]
Tell me the reason why
You committed love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose
I'm all out of tears
Time to get outta here
You made it very clear
You did it on purpose (Uh)

[Hook (Condensed): Ester Dean (Tinie Tempah)]
Our love suicide
Our love suicide (Love suicide)
Our love suicide (Uh)

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
I feel like I'm about to break down
Why you acting like a kid up in a playground? (Huh?)
If you got something on your mind why don't you lay it out?
Feels like the end of us is coming any day now
Any day, I thought we'd never separate
I could be destroyed but not defeated: Ernest Hemingway
You know its probably for the best anyway
'Cause my suspicions now is worrying your jealous face
Let's go our separate ways, uh

[Refrain: Tinie Tempah]
What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house
And everything becomes so cold?
Baby, that's the only thing I wanna know

[Chorus 1: Ester Dean (Tinie Tempah)]
Tell me the reason why
You committed love suicide (Suicide)
I think you want our love to die (Uh)
You did it on purpose
I'm all out of tears (I'm all out of tears)
Time to get outta here
You made it very clear (Uh)
You did it on purpose

[Hook: Ester Dean (Tinie Tempah)]
Our love suicide
Our love suicide (Love suicide)
Our love suicide (Uh)
Why would you hurt us?
Our love suicide
Our love suicide (Love suicide)
Our love suicide (Uh, yeah)

[Bridge: Ester Dean]
Does it make you happy to see me down?
Does it make your day to see me drown?
I guess I'm your entertainment
You don't know what you wasted
But soon you will see
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Tinie Tempah]
What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Within four walls and one house
And everything becomes so cold?
Baby, that's the only thing I wanna know

[Chorus 2: Ester Dean (Tinie Tempah)]
Tell me the reason why (Why)
You committed love suicide (Uh)
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose (No)
I'm all out of tears (I'm all out of tears)
Time to get outta here
You made it very clear (Uh)
You did it on purpose, purpose (Suicide, love suicide)
You did it on purpose, purpose (Suicide, love suicide)
Made me feel worthless, worthless (Suicide, love suicide)
Why would you hurt us, hurt us?
You did it on purpose, purpose (Suicide, love suicide)
You did it on purpose, purpose (Suicide, love suicide)
You made me feel worthless, worthless (Suicide, love suicide)
Why would you hurt us, hurt us?

[Outro: Tinie Tempah]
What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house
And everything becomes so cold?[Verse 1]
I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I know that you've been wondering
Mmm, so here goes nothing

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Verse 2]
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
One of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm, it's time you hear em

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Bridge]
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout ya
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah, you had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
In case you didn't know[Verse 1]
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going nowhere with no one but me
I was one in a hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me

[Chorus 1]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Verse 2]
I was a worn out set of shoes
Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

[Chorus 2]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Bridge]
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea

[Chorus 2]
I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Outro]
Thank God I'm yours
Thank God I'm yours, yours
Thank God I'm yours[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
He's as cool as California
Homegrown like they do it in Georgia
With a heart as big as the Lone Star State
Hard to catch like a Kansas breeze
Strong like a Tennessee hickory
He's smooth like the bourbon Kentucky makes

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Hot like the Phoenix sun, y'all
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm fallin' like a Denver snowfall

[Chorus]
Whole world in my living room
It's all you, babe
If I could paint paradise, it'd be you
It's all you, babe
Every red pin on the map I'm holding
You're everywhere I've been
And everywhere I'm goin'
From Backwoods to the neon glowin'
You're everywhere I've been
And everywhere I'm goin'

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
He's my one-way outta town
Even sitting shotgun riding around
Feels like an East Coast, coastline drive
He's a take-my-breath like a Paris sunset
Takes my heart where it hasn't been yet

[Chorus]
Whole world in my living room
It's all you, babe
If I could paint paradise, it'd be you
It's all you, babe
Every red pin on the map I'm holding
You're everywhere I've been
And everywhere I'm goin'
From Backwoods to the neon glowin'
You're everywhere I've been
And everywhere I'm goin'

[Post-Chorus]
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere I'm goin'

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Hot like the Phoenix sun y'all
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm fallin' like a Denver snowfall

[Chorus]
Whole world in my living room
It's all you, babe
If I could paint paradise, it'd be you
It's all you, babe
Every red pin on the map I'm holding
You're everywhere I've been
And everywhere I'm goin'
From Backwoods to the neon glowin'
You're everywhere I've been
And everywhere I'm goin'

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Everywhere I'm goin', goin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Everywhere I've been and everywhere I'm goin'

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh[Verse 1]
This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic, don't it?
I'm right where I wanna be

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this

[Verse 2]
I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never
Had to even leave this room

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
Could be better than this

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this (heaven)
Could be better than this (heaven, heaven)

[Outro]
I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time[Verse 1]
I've never seen Venice
Or slow danced under Paris lights
Never stood by the pyramids
Or hiked up the great divide
I've never been to Times Square
To celebrate the New Year
And I've never seen Willie Nelson live
And if I never get to
That's alright

[Chorus]
'Cause I've seen you with your hair down in your bare feet
Dancin' 'round the living room spillin' wine on your dress
And I've seen you on a bench seat
In a tank top and your blue jeans
Gettin' your lipstick on my neck
So if all I do is live in this small town with you
And never leave
I've seen all I need to see

[Verse 2]
I've never seen Ireland
And those green hills that roll for miles
But my guess is that they ain't got nothin' on your green eyes
And I've never seen Niagara falls or stood inside the prison walls
Where Cash recorded live
Some may say I'm missin' out
But that's a lie

[Chorus]
'Cause I've seen you when your song's on
And you're singin' words that are all wrong
And you swear to me that that's how it goes
And I've seen you when tears fall
'Cause the episode that you just saw
Felt like more than just a show
So if all I do is live in this small town with you
And never leave
I've seen all I need to see

[Outro]
Yeah, I've seen you with your hair down in your bare feet
Dancin' 'round the living room spillin' wine on your dress
And I've seen you on a bench seat
In a tank top and your blue jeans
Gettin' your lipstick on my neck
So if all I do is live in this small town with you
And never leave
Yeah, that'd be fine with me
'Cause I've seen all I need to see[Verse 1]
"You know when you know," you hear that all your life
Well whoever they are, turns out they were right
Sunshine, the good times, yeah, we got a few behind us
But when the bad times come, I ain't gonna run

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
I'll be wrapped around your finger
Girl, you got me 'til we run out of time
Rich or poor, rain or shine
The wind's gonna blow wherever it goes
And the road is gonna wind
Doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
Forevermore, I'll be yours and you'll be mine

[Verse 2]
When I look at you now, I see all I ever wanted
You make me wanna hang around
And hold your hand, we're a hundred
You make love feel so real, so simple and honest
It's in every breath and every kiss
Yeah, the thing about you is

[Chorus]
Doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
I'll be wrapped around your finger
Girl, you got me 'til we run out of time
Rich or poor, rain or shine
The wind's gonna blow wherever it goes
And the road is gonna wind
Doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
Forevermore, I'll be yours and you'll be mine

[Bridge]
You'll be mine, baby
It don't matter where or whatever happens
Girl, I'll still be there

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
I'll be wrapped around your finger
Girl, you got me 'til we run out of time
Rich or poor, rain or shine
The wind's gonna blow wherever it goes
And the road is gonna wind
It doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine (Diamonds or twine)
It doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
Forevermore, I'll be yours and you'll be mine

[Outro]
Diamonds or twine[Intro]
This is the end of Side One of this record
Please now turn it over for the second side

[Verse 1]
I got a phone that won't die
You're up in the air, landing tonight
So I'll leave a message for ya, get it when you touch down
If I'm being honest, I'm a little drunk now
I got a bed that's too big without ya
I got a heart that don't beat without ya
Get so jealous when you ain't by my side
I know it's selfish, but I need you tonight

[Chorus]
So text when you touch down, straight to my place now
These nights without you, they're so hard to sleep
Come put your things down, I'll order take out
No more to say now, baby, just make out with me
Baby, just make out with me

[Verse 2]
You got a kiss I still taste
And I feel your lips from miles away
I got one more minute of this message to burn
I hope you get it 'cause I mean every word

[Chorus]
So text when you touch down, straight to my place now
These nights without you, they're so hard to sleep
Come put your things down, I'll order take out
No more to say now, baby, just make out with me
Baby, just make out with me
Just like it used to be, baby, just make out with me[Verse 1]
You said "I love you" to me
And I don't know what that means
So I froze on my feet
People use it so carelessly
And I couldn’t believe
That you would dive in so deep
And you said perfectly
Everything I’ve been feelin' about you
It’s time to break the chains that held me back from you

[Chorus]
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

[Verse 2]
Well I was never the type
To put it all on the line
But I've been changing my mind since you opened my eyes
It was the way that the light
Picked you out of that night
Then you were right by my side
Put a soul in my body
And now it’s time to close the space between the two of us

[Chorus]
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

[Bridge]
Oh, baby it's time
Oh, it's time

[Chorus]
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now

[Outro]
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line[Verse 1]
Like a rainy Sunday mornin'
Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs

[Bridge]
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Verse 2]
You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah, I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Bridge]
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
You make it easySometimes no matter how hard you try
This life's gonna be unfair sometimes
I see you looking at me like you wanna know why
Baby, you got me, you got me
I don't know why the wind that blows
Ain't ever at our back
Or that the road that we're rollin on ain't ever flat
It turns and it twists
Don't know what the answer is, but

You, you got me
When the pieces don't fall together
When you wish your best was better, baby
You, you got me
Right here by your side hanging on for the ride
When your dreams don't dream and the songs don't sing
And the grass ain't green and the ends don't meet
And the prayers you're sending up don't seem to reach
You got me

Those days when your faith ain't pulling you through
I'll be right there believing enough for two
When you don't give a damn cause you think that you can't
Get the mountain to move I'll be saying we can
I'll be taking your hand, and I'll never let go
Baby you gotta know

That you, you got me
When the pieces don't fall together
When you wish your best was better, baby
You, you got me
Right here by your side hanging on for the ride
When your dreams don't dream and the songs don't sing
And the grass ain't green and the ends don't meet
And the prayers you're sending up don't seem to reach
You got me

Sometimes no matter how hard you try
This life's gonna be unfair sometimes

But you, you got me
When the pieces don't fall together
When you wish your best was better, baby
You, you got me
Right here by your side hanging on for the ride
When your dreams don't dream and the songs don't sing
And the grass ain't green and the ends don't meet
And the prayers you're sending up don't seem to reach
You got me
You got me[Verse 1]
I know it's not likely to falling so easily
But  I'm falling soon as you walk in the room
I  know that you don't mean to make it like this for me
But I'm breaking breaking all my walls for you
Now you looking at me looking back at you
I'm  trying to figure out what I'm gonna do

[Chorus]
I  don't know how, how to slow down with you
But baby I don't know now if I even want to
You  got my heartbeat beating at a speed of light
I'm so caught up couldn't tell you why
But baby I don't know how, how to slow down with you
Yeah, I don't know how

[Verse 2]
I'm  fine wasting time in your headlights all night tonight
If it was anybody else I would've gone home by now
I don't know what it is but this is different
Even when you're here I kinda miss you, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't know how, how to slow down with you
But baby I don't know now if I even want to
Yeah, you got my heartbeat beating at a speed of light
I'm so caught up couldn't tell you why
But baby I don't know how, how to slow down with you

Yeah, I don't know how
Baby I don't know how, how to slow down
Baby I don't know how, how to slow down
Oh yeah

I don't know how, how to slow down with you, yeah
But baby I don't know now if I even want to
Yeah, you got my heartbeat beating at a speed of light
I'm so caught up couldn't tell you why
But baby I don't know how, how to slow down with you

Yeah, I don't know how
I don't know how
I don't know how to slow down[Verse 1]
This is the gospel, according to me
A tale of whiskey turned to wine
Ain't no movin’ of a mountain, ain't no parting of the sea
But I stand here a witness of something just as divine

[Chorus]
My miracle is five foot five
No doubt in my mind, she's the reason I’m alive
I wasn't always spiritual, oh, but one thing's for sure
How could I not have faith in the God that created her?

[Verse 2]
My mama used to pray someday I'd see the light
I never thought it'd be in someone's eyes
In a crowded restaurant on a Friday night
I heard angels sing, my whole life changed, and I realized

[Chorus]
My miracle was standin' right there
Lookin' so beautiful with blue jeans and long brown hair
I wasn’t always spiritual, oh, but one thing’s for sure
How could I not have faith in the God that created her?

[Bridge]
You see me now, it's crazy how
My life changed
But here I stand, a better man
And you can blame my miracle

[Outro]
I wasn’t always spiritual, oh, but one thing's for sure
How could I not have faith
Yeah, how could anybody not have faith
In the God that created her?[Verse 1]
I hate Shakespeare and Gosling and cakes with white frosting
Two names in a heart-shaped tattoo
I think cupid is stupid and violets are purple not blue
I hate catching bouquets, the honeymoon phase
And letterman jackets don't fit
Your eyes can't hold stars and you'd die if your heart really skipped

[Chorus]
I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you

[Verse 2]
I hate pink hearts with glitter and Valentine's dinner
And roses just die in a week
We were drunk when we met so we don't know our anniversary (Whoops)
Oh, and I'm far too vain to kiss in the rain
The clouds, they aren't numbered to nine
And you make me feel something
But it sure as hell ain't butterflies

[Chorus]
I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
Yeah

[Interlude]
I really do

[Bridge]
And I'll always love you but I don't have to sing it
"For worse or for better" don't rhyme
They say I got the right one so now I should write one
But I'd rather just show you tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
I hate love songs
The old and the new
I hate love songs
But I love you[Verse 1]
Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm

[Verse 2]
Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah
Mmm

[Bridge]
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace

[Chorus 2]
Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man
Mmm[Verse 1]
I got a fast car, gassed up, sittin' in the driveway
Got a road that I know like the back of my hand
We could head out right now, baby, we could fly away
And disappear outta here fast as we can

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I miss you, baby
Ooh, I'm going crazy

[Chorus]
There's a diamond sky that's waitin' for us just outside of town
With the moon hangin' for me and you, baby
We can cut the headlights out when there ain't no one else around
Kill the space in between, slide across that leather seat
Heart to heart, face to face, you know all I wanna do
Is get closer, closer, closer to you
Closer to you

[Verse 2]
Wanna taste that great wide open freedom
Wanna make the distance razor thin
Wanna feel you feel me feel you breathing
'Til we can't tell where you end and where I begin

[Chorus]
There's a diamond sky that's waiting for us just outside of town
With the moon hangin' for me and you, baby
We can cut the headlights out when there ain't no one else around
Kill the space in between, slide across that leather seat
Heart to heart, face to face, you know all I wanna do
Is get closer, closer, closer to you
Closer to you, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I miss you, baby
Ooh, I'm going crazy

[Chorus]
There's a diamond sky that's waiting for us just outside of town
With the moon hangin' for me and you, baby
We can cut the headlights out when there ain't no one else around
Kill the space in between, slide across that leather seat
Heart to heart, face to face, you know all I wanna do
Is get closer, closer, closer to you
Closer to you
Closer, closer, closer to you
Closer to you[Verse 1]
Did I stop and watch the sunset fade?
What gave me life and took my breath away?
Did I take a last-call stranger home
So I wouldn't have to wake up alone?

[Chorus]
I heard I was a wild one
Actin like a child, son
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me

[Verse 2]
Was I just another ghost in this town?
Who was I when no one was around?
Did I even know that I was livin' without?
Who are my favorite songs about?

[Chorus]
I heard I was a wild one
Actin like a child, son
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me

[Bridge]
Was my heart beatin' in my chest?
And was I even alive before the day we met?

[Chorus]
I heard I was a wild one
Actin' like a child, son
Heard I was a fast one
Always was last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me
No, I don't remember me before you[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]
Sitting with you in a dark room
Warmed by a fireplace
You know there's just something about you
You brighten my day
I got something to run past you
I just hope I say it right
So I take your hand and ask you
Have you made plans for the rest of your life?

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worryin' about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives

[Verse 2: Faith Hill]
I've been making plans for children
Since I've been looking in your eyes
I even have names picked out for them
Daughter'd be Rose
Son, it'd be Ryan

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worrying about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives

[Bridge: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
I don't really care about those storm clouds brewing
Oh, as long as you're here by my side
Oh, we'll be young, oh we'll be young
Oh, we'll be young, when we're old

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
Oh, I'll be fine
If my gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even when time takes its toll
I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you, I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you
We'll stay young for the rest of our life[Verse 1]
They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 2]
So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

[Chorus 2]
When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 3]
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen

[Outro]
We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me[Verse 1]
I feel like 16, sneakin' out in Daddy's car tonight
Index finger tracin' all the stars in your eyes
It was music playin' in the background
But I don't even care what they're singin' about
I'm just 16, sneakin' out in Daddy's car tonight

[Chorus]
I'ma need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
Timeout right now 'cause I'm fallin' too fast for you
Listenin' to your life story on the hood of a '64 Cadillac
One, I'ma lean in to kiss you
Two, say a little too much too soon
Three, try not to forget to breathe
I need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
1-2-3, Mississippi

[Verse 2]
Like a roller coaster car comin' off the tracks
Watchin' all my self control fall through your hands
I know I could try to fight this
But right now it looks like this
Rollercoaster car is comin' off the tracks, yeah

[Chorus]
I'ma need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
Timeout right now 'cause I'm fallin' too fast for you
Listenin' to your life story on the hood of a '64 Cadillac
One, I'ma lean in to kiss you
Two, say a little too much too soon
Three, try not to forget to breathe
I need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
1-2-3, Mississippi, yeah

[Bridge]
Count down to the point of no return
But count fast, baby I'm already yours

[Chorus]
I'ma need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
Timeout right now 'cause I'm fallin' too fast for you
Listenin' to your life story on the hood of a '64 Cadillac
One, I'ma lean in to kiss you
Two, say a little too much too soon
Three, try not to forget to breathe
I need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
1-2-3, Mississippi, mmm
Oh, Mississippi
1-2, 1-2-3, Mississippi
Whoa, whoa, Mississippi[Verse 1]
Girl, I would dial your number without lookin'
And  you’d always pick it up as soon as it rang
And  I'd hear you say, "I hear my Mama coming"
And you'd hide the phone up underneath the sheets

[Chorus]
And I’d hear her say, "Girl, haven't I told you?
Yeah,  I know who you're talking to
It's  that bad boy
It's that wrong-side-of-the-tracks boy
That  break-your-heart-and-won't-come-back boy
Why's that boy the one you love?"
You're not that bad boy

[Verse 2]
You weren’t scared but you had every reason
Me  and my boys were nothin’ short of dangerous
But you said, "Boy, you know I've heard you talk to Jesus
How’s a tough guy like you afraid to love?"

[Chorus]
You ain't so bad boy
You've done some things you can't take back, boy
But I see straight through that boy
And that boy is the one I love

[Bridge]
You ain’t so bad boy
No, you ain't so bad
You ain't so bad

[Verse 3]
Well, I remember sitting down beside your Mama
My hands shaking in my pocket with that ring
She said, "Boy, I always knew you loved my daughter
She loves you too and I think I know what she sees"
So alright, bad boy
Long as them old habits don't come back, boy
You know that's how she lost her dad, boy
And that boy is the one I loved
He was my bad boy
He was my bad boy

[Outro]
Guess you ain't so bad
No, you ain't so bad

[Verse 1]
Watchin' you watch me take down my hair
Slow motion falling, feeling your stare
I wish your hands were where your eyes are at
Tracing my shoulders all the way down my back
You're like a different language I want to speak
Like a handsome stranger I want to meet
You make me want to know all the unknown
Paintin' up trouble like gold

[Chorus]
You get away
With making me want
To forever stay here in your space everyday
You get away with it
You get away
With making me fawn, making me trip
'Gain and again, everyday
You get away with it

[Verse 2]
Keep the red pourin' 'cause I know we're done
I'm all here for it, this buzz has just begun
You slid right under that yellow caution tape
And I never questioned a thing

[Chorus]
You get away
With making me want
To forever stay here in your space everyday
You get away with it
You get away
With making me fawn, making me trip
'Gain and again, everyday
You get away with it

[Bridge]
You're makin' me trip
Makin' me want to stay forever
Everyday baby
Again and again, and again, and again, and again, everyday
Again and again, and again, and again, and again, everyday
Don't just leave, now

[Chorus]
You get away (You get away)
With making me want
To forever stay here in your space everyday
You get away with it
You get away
With making me fawn, making me trip
'Gain and again, everyday (Every single damn day)
You get away with it
You get away
With making me want
To forever stay here in your space everyday
(Here in your space, baby)
You get away with it
You get away
With making me fawn, making me trip
'Gain and again, everyday
You get away
With it[Verse 1]
All that I know
Is you caught me at the right time
Keep me in your glow
'Cause I'm having such a good time
With you

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
I used to get sad
And lonely when the sun went down
But it's different now
'Cause I love the light that I've found
In you

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

[Bridge]
You make the world look beautiful, ooh
I thought I'd seen it all before
But looking through your eyes
It looks like paradise

[Chorus]
You've set my world on fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
You're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Yeah, I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Golden hour[Verse 1: Trisha Yearwood]
You were the light that wounds the eye
The pain that time could not deny
I felt resistance fading fast
As if you saved the heart for last
I knew right then, no matter what
That this would take all that I've got
There's really nothing I could do
Oh, this much in love with you

[Chorus: Trisha Yearwood & Don Henley]
So break my faith, forget my name
Either way, it's all the same
You're my first word, my last breath
My will to live when nothing's left
Tear this heart right out of me
Lock it up, then lose the key
Curse my name when you kneel to pray
I'm gonna love you anyway

[Verse 2]
I toss and turn helplessly
There's nothin' no one can do for me
You're the first thought in my soul
There's no regaining my control
And should one day I stand accused
By other loves I have refused
When hope is gone and I am weak
You are the last name I will speak

[Chorus: Trisha Yearwood & Don Henley]
So break my faith, forget my name
Either way, it's all the same
You're my first word, my last breath
My will to live when nothing's left
Tear this heart right out of me
Lock it up, then lose the key
Curse my name when you kneel to pray
I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love you anyway[Verse 1]
I'd promise you forever if I could
If I could slow down the hands of time I would
I know they say all good things must end
If I could do it all over I would do it all over
Over and over again

[Chorus]
We'll go on 'til were pushin' up daisies
We'll grow old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby
We'll never get enough, we'll be livin' it up right down to the day we die
Naw, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive

[Verse 2]
'Til I held you close I never felt the feelin'
And now I'll feel that way 'til the last sunset goes down
You turned a stubborn southern boy into a believer
Believe me when I say, "It's gonna stay that way 'til they lay me in the ground"

[Chorus]
We'll go on 'til we're pushing up daisies
We'll grow old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby
We'll never get enough, we'll be livin' it up right down to the day we die
Naw, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive

[Chorus]
We'll go on 'til were pushing up daisies
We'll be old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby
We'll never get enough, we'll be livin' it up right down to the day we die
Naw, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive

[Outro]
When our last breath is gone
And they carve our name in stone
Oh, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive[Verse 1]
You were talkin' trash, we were tossin' bags
When I caught your name at a corn hole game
September Saturday in Rocky Top
On top of G10 parking lot
Said "Girl, where you sittin'? I got an extra ticket
It's right on the 50"

[Chorus]
You had a 16 home team jersey on
Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watchin' you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You would've thought that post-game kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime

[Verse 2]
They sent out the Pride of the Southland band
And all I could think about was holdin' your hand
Was just gonna catch it on a couch TV
And last second scored a couple tickets for free
But baby I'd have paid anything to see

[Chorus]
You had a 16 home team jersey on
Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watchin' you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You would've thought that post-game kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime

[Bridge]
Now every time the leaves start fallin' down
I get to thinkin' 'bout

[Chorus]
That 16 home team jersey on
Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watchin' you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You would've thought that post-game kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime
You had me by halftime
You had me by halftime[Verse 1]
It all starts when it's me and you, going out on Friday night
Feels like the radio when your tires roll into my drive
Then my heart stops, like a beat drop
It's a symphony when you sweet talk
Make this quiet town, feel electric, loud
When the lights going down
Every word out of your mouth

[Chorus]
Is like music
Like a 70's soundtrack
When you look at me like that
I lose it
My name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss
When I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out
We're not saying nothing
But it's feeling something like music

[Verse 2]
Before I knew your love
Even with the volume up, it was silent then
And now you're walking in the room all kind of smooth,  like a violin
Everybody else is white noise
So talk to me, cause your voice

[Chorus]
Is like music
Like a 70's soundtrack
When you look at me like that
I lose it
My name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss
When I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out
We're not saying nothing
But it's feeling something like music

I-I-I

[Bridge]
Your song on my skin is like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
So play it again just like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Your song on my skin is like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
So play it again
My whole heart's listening to your music

[Chorus]
Like a 70's soundtrack
When you look at me like that
I lose it
My name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss
When I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out
We're not saying nothing
But it's feeling something like music[Verse 1]
I’ll never settle down
That’s what I always thought
Yeah, I was that kind of man
Just ask anyone

[Chorus]
I don’t dance, But here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It Ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand
Cause, I don’t dance

[Verse 2]
Love’s never come my way
I’ve never been this far
Cause you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart

[Chorus]
No, I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don’t dance
Ohhh
I don’t dance

Ooh

I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere

I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yeah, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don’t dance

Oh
No..

Oooh…[Verse 1]
I took your coat
I wasn't that cold
Gotta a little too close
Come on, don't ya know?
Am I giving you enough to let you know that I want ya?
My heart's beating out loud like thunder
Are you gonna kiss me?
Are you gonna make me wonder?

[Chorus]
It's your move, boy
I'll follow you, boy
I ain't gonna lead, I'm a lady like that
So I'm gonna keep looking at you like I-I-I dare you
I-I-I'm gonna keep looking at ya like I-I-I dare ya

[Verse 2]
These strung up lights are staring right at us
It'd be the perfect time to mess my lipstick up
Tryna keep my cool, but you give me fire
I'm already high, but you could take me higher
Turn this sweet night into something wilder

[Chorus]
It's your move, boy
I'll follow you, boy
I ain't gonna lead, I'm a lady like that
So I'm gonna keep looking at you like I-I-I dare you
I-I-I'm gonna keep looking at ya like I-I-I dare ya

[Bridge]
Am I giving you enough to let you know that I want ya?
My heart's beating out loud like thunder
Are you gonna kiss me?
Are you gonna make me wonder?

[Chorus]
Oh, it's your move, boy
I'll follow you, boy
I ain't gonna lead, I'm a lady like that
So I'm gonna keep looking at you like I-I-I dare you
I-I-I'm gonna keep looking at ya like I-I-I dare ya
It's your move boy
I'll follow you boy
I ain't gonna lead, I'm a lady like that
So I'm gonna keep looking at you like I-I-I dare you
I-I-I'm gonna keep looking at ya like I-I-I dare ya
So I'm gonna keep looking at you like I-I-I dare you[Verse 1]
Girl, it's high time I tell ya
No more messin' around
Time to lay these cards on the table
And just throw it on out
I'm talkin' you and me with the same street name
Same last name, same everything
It's a real thing, a how I feel thing
So I'm a go on and take a swing

[Chorus]
You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeah

[Verse 2]
You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch
If you put a little tea in my glass
Watch a sunset from a gravel road
Kiss me in the kitchen on your tippy toes
Still lovin' on you when the rooster crows
Watchin' way more than the garden grow

[Chorus]
You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs

[Bridge]
Yeah, layin' next to you every night
Sounds like a damn good life

[Chorus]
You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs

[Outro]
Yeah, I'll name the dogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs
Yeah, I'll name the dogsI miss you, I need you
I want you to touch me
We don't have to speak
Let our bodies do the talking

Never get enough, never get enough
So bring me all your love
Hurry it up
Whatever you want
Got my permission

Tonight we can do anything
We can be everything we want to be
And I, I want to feel your lips
And give you all that you've been missing
Champagne rush straight to my head
Got me love drunk, laying in my bed
You don't even need to try
You just set my body on fire
You just set my body on fire

I'm reckless
Only you make me do this
No we can't stop it
And I don't want to stop baby

Never get enough, never get enough
So bring me all your love
Hurry it up
I want to give you, give you my attention

Tonight we can do anything
We can be everything we want to be
And I, I want to feel your lips
And give you all that you've been missing
Champagne rush straight to my head
Got me love drunk, laying in my bed
You don't even need to try
You just set my body on fire
You just set my body on fire

Never get enough, never get enough
So bring me all your love
Hurry it up
I want to give you, give you my attention

Tonight we can do anything
We can be everything we want to be
And I, I want to feel your lips
And give you all that you've been missing
Champagne rush straight to my head
Got me love drunk, laying in my bed
You don't even need to try
You just set my body on fire
You just set my body on fire[Verse 1]
We could go down to the lake
Throw off our shoes
Jump into the water like there's nothing to lose
Sky don't get no bluer, love don't get no truer than this
Then you could wrap me in a blanket
And steal a kiss
Then we could go into town
To that little coffee shop
Go sit under the stars, up on the rooftop
Spend an hour talking, watch the people walking by
When the coffee gets colder you can just hold me tight

[Verse 2]
Something special, something we don't do all the time
Something special, because I am yours and you are mine

[Verse 3]
A little celebration, just because we can
Walking by your side with my hand in your hand
Make a little history, make the kind of memories that last
Stop and smell the roses
You know they go so fast

[Verse 4]
Something special, something we don't do all the time
Something special, because I am yours and we can
Go down to the lake throw off our shoes
Jump into the water like there’s nothing to lose[Verse 1]
If I ever left this town
I'd never settle down
I'd just be wandering around
If I ever left this town
If I wasn't by your side
I'd never be satisfied
Nothing would feel just right
If I wasn't by your side

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm not easy to understand
But you know me like the back of your hand
I'm your girl and you're my man
And we're makin' plans
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
We can go on and on
Won't ever feel too long
I'll always call you home
And we'll go on and on

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I know you like the back of my hand
Got a heart of gold and a piece of land
I'm your girl and you're my man
And we're makin' plans
Mmm, mmm[Verse 1]
I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd, oh
But I can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh whoa, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
What are we waiting on?

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

[Bridge]
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, with the
River rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
We're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh

[Intro: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Oh, oh-oh

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2: Lil Nas X]
Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Verse 3: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Outro: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more[Verse 1]
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that "come get me" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Verse 2]
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV"
And she falls asleep

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Bridge]
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me[Verse 1]
Poor me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell nah
I just wanna sip 'til the pain wears off
Poor me, pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

[Chorus]
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)

[Verse 2]
Last call
I swear this will be my last call
Now I ain't drunk dialing no more at 3 am
Mr. Bartender hittin' me again

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

[Chorus]
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses

Oh, see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back
Fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up
'Cause if she ain't ever coming back
Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back
Fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up

And see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)
Yeah[Verse 1]
You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new

[Pre-Chorus]
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Verse 2]
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'

[Chorus]
And I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Bridge]
Yeah, baby, mmm
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
You standin' there in that dress
Girl, it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
Oh, I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Outro]
Oh, you know it, baby
Mmm[Verse 1]
Been flyin' solo for so long
Nobody's singin' the harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass, no guitar, no tambourine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I found you like a melody
You were singin' in the same key as me
We had ‘em dancin' in the streets

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
I don't wanna be a one man band
No

[Verse 2]
I wanna run down your wild dreams
And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rip in these old jeans
We'll never learn how to sing the blues

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I'm gonna be famous
Girl, I wanna be famous with you
We got our own little groove

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band

[Bridge]
When the spotlight goes cold, and the curtains come down
The chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around
And nobody's payin', we’ll still be playin'

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a one man band[Verse 1]
I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine

[Chorus]
But when I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)

[Verse 2]
I can kiss somebody brand new
And not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory, it only hits me this hard

[Chorus]
When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)

[Bridge]
I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk and I'm thinkin'
How I need your love, how I need your love, yeah, it sinks in

[Chorus]
When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
Ooh[Verse 1]
We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long til I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Outro]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Still chasing you, still chasing you[Verse 1]
I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking about her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me

[Verse 2]
Yeah then I hope she shows up in a 2 am pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone
And then she calls
And baby I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget and take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me

[Bridge]
I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way
About her that I feel about you right now

[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
Like you did on me[Intro]
Right now
I just need you to get real loose
Get comfortable

And if you're by yourself, no worries
Just follow after me

That was not so bad, that was, that, that was not so bad, was it?
That was not so bad, that, that, that was not so bad, was it?
That was not so bad, that was, that, that was not so bad, was it?
That was not so bad, that, that, that was not so bad, was it?

Sunday morning
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

[Chorus 2]
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

[Bridge]
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours[Verse 1]
I've had a largemouth bass bust my line
A couple beautiful girls tell me goodbye
Trucks break down, dogs run off
Politicians lie, been fired by the boss

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
No, there ain't much, man
That ain't never let me down

[Chorus]
Longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart

[Verse 2]
She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red taillights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now

[Chorus]
But longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, it takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
But I got one hand
That's grippin' down on a cold one

[Chorus]
'Cause longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars, and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, no
It never broke my heart[Verse 1]
Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Verse 2]
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Bridge]
We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Outro]
I'ma take it slow
Just as fast as I can (Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed)
Got braids in her hair (I know every curve like the back of my hand)[Verse 1]
Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Verse 2]
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

[Chorus]
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Bridge]
Yeah, you hit me Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane[Verse 1]
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from bein' too far gone

[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Verse 2]
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothin' like your love to get me high

[Chorus]
And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Outro]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey[Verse 1]
We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

[Verse 2]
Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when my bones are good
When the bones are good

[Bridge]
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Baby, it don't really matter)
Paint could peel, the glass could shatter (Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter)
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Ooh)
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Yeah)

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain)
'Cause you and I remain the same (Woo)
When there ain't a crack in the foundation (Woo)
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

[Outro]
Yeah, ooh[Verse 1]
I wish girls you loved never gave back diamond rings
I wish every porch had a swing
Wish kids still learned to say "sir" and "ma'am", how to shake a hand
I wish every state had a Birmingham

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish everybody knew all the words to Mama Tried
I wish Monday mornings felt just like Friday nights

[Chorus]
And I wish even cars had truck beds
And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never run out of cold Bud Light
And I wish high school home teams never lost

And back road drinkin' kids never got caught
And I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honky tonks didn't have no closing time
And I wish grandpas never died

[Verse 2]
I wish Sunday's on a creek bank would never end
Wish I could learn to drive again
Wish the first time, seventeen, she was my everything kiss in a Chevrolet could happen every day

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish everybody overseas was gonna make it home
I wish Country music still got played on Country radio

[Chorus]
And I wish even cars had truck beds
And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never run out of cold Bud Light
And I wish high school home teams never lost

And back road drinkin' kids never got caught
And I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honky tonks didn't have no closing time
And I wish grandpas never died

Never died

[Bridge]
And I wish good dogs never got grey and old
I wish farms never got sold

[Chorus]
And I wish even cars had truck beds
And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never run out of cold Bud Light
I wish high school home teams never lost

And back road drinkin' kids never got caught
And I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honky tonks didn't have no closing time
And I wish grandpas never died

I wish grandpas never died[Verse 1]
(I saw you going by)
I saw you going by, I had to say hello
And I don't mean to pry, but girl, I gotta know
What is your name?
How come I ain't seen you around before? (Tell me)
You know I ain't ever had a type, having a type takes two
But I know what I like, and you're the only one of you
You're something else (Damn)
And I know we just met, but

[Chorus]
I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks, to my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown, where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it, but honey, you got my hopes up
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks

[Verse 2]
(I wanna take you home)
I wanna take you home, not just take you home tonight
Get Joanie on the phone, she'll leave us on a light
I wanna see the way you look up under all those stars, yeah
You're gonna be the talk, word's gonna get around
They'll tell you how they thought I'd never settle down
Out on the porch, ain't it funny the way things change?

[Chorus]
I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks, to my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown, where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it, but honey, you got my hopes up
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks

[Bridge]
I don't wanna wait around for the right time

[Chorus]
I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks, to my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown, where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it, but honey, you got my hopes up
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks

[Outro]
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks
Woah[Verse 1]
I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I know that you've been wondering
Mmm, so here goes nothing

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Verse 2]
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
One of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm, it's time you hear em

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Bridge]
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout ya
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah, you had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
In case you didn't know[Intro]
Gaslighter, denier
Doin' anything to get your ass farther
Gaslighter, big timer
Repeating all of the mistakes of your father

[Verse 1]
We moved to California and we followed your dreams
I believed in the promises you made to me
Swore that night 'til death do us part
But you lie-lie-lie-lie-lied
Hollywood welcomed you with open doors
No matter what they gave you, you still wanted more
Acting all above it when our friends divorced
What a lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
You're such a

[Chorus]
Gaslighter, denier
Doin' anything to get your ass farther
Gaslighter, big timer
Repeating all of the mistakes of your father
Gaslighter, you broke me
You're sorry, but where's my apology?
Gaslighter, you liar

[Verse 2]
You thought I wouldn't see it if you put it in my face
Give you all my money, you'll gladly walk away
You think it's justifiable, I think it's pretty cruel
And you know you lie best when you lie to you
'Cause, boy, you know exactly what you did on my boat
And, boy, that's exactly why you ain't comin' home
Save your tired stories for your new someone else
'Cause they're lie-lie-lie-lie-lies
Look out, you little

[Chorus]
Gaslighter, denier
Doin' anything to get your ass farther (Ooh)
Gaslighter, big timer
Repeating all of the mistakes of your father
Gaslighter, you broke me
You're sorry, but where's my apology?
Gaslighter, you liar

[Verse 3]
Just had to start a fire, had to start a fire
Couldn't take yourself on a road a little higher
Had to burn it up, had to tear it down
Tried to say I'm crazy, babe, we know I'm not crazy, that's you
Gaslighting
You're a li-li-li-liar
Oh, honey, that's you
Gaslighting
You made your bed and then your bed caught fire

[Bridge]
Gaslighter, I'm your mirror
Standin' right here until you can see how you broke me
Yeah, I'm broken
You're still sorry, and there's still no apology

[Chorus]
Gaslighter, denier (Yeah)
Doin' anything to get your ass farther (Ooh)
Gaslighter, big timer
Repeating all of the mistakes of your father (Gaslighter)
Gaslighter, you broke me
You're sorry, but where's my apology?
Gaslighter, you liar[Verse 1]
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

[Verse 2]
Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared I might be here
But I'll always be right there
Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

[Bridge]
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye
Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own
There's no way that I can walk this road alone
Daddy grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, boy, I ain't scared
I won't be here, but I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't goin' nowhere[Verse 1]
This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic, don't it?
I'm right where I wanna be

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this

[Verse 2]
I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never
Had to even leave this room

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
Could be better than this

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this (heaven)
Could be better than this (heaven, heaven)

[Outro]
I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time[Verse 1]
Lights go down, wheels go 'round
I'm taking you home
Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now
I'm not ready to shut it down
The way the dashboard glow
Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind
And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot
Stop this car and throw it in park and just

[Chorus]
Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot
(Slow dance in a parking lot)

[Verse 2]
A half song gone, one door open, across the lot
A rent-a-cop's rolling a security car
Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time
To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks
You start humming the very last verse to "She's Every Woman"
And I don't care what song comes next
I'm falling right here, don't want a safety net in a

[Chorus]
Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot

[Post-Chorus]
And get close to you
Making the most of whatever we got, even if it's just

[Chorus]
A slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot[Chorus]
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin’ new friends
I was growin' up and nothing made sense
Buzzin' all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this

[Verse 1]
Couldn’t wait to turn 21
The day I did, I got too drunk
Spin around dizzy on the patio
Found out real quick how to take it slow
Got whiskey bent on whiskey sours
Ran my mouth to an out-of-towner
Learned a big lesson when I met the bouncer

[Chorus]
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin' new friends
I was growin' up and nothing made sense
Buzzin' all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this bar

[Post Chorus]
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh
I found myself in this bar

[Verse 2]
Saw her in the corner sippin' something tall
Cracked a few jokes, we hit off
Get down the road I'm watching her
Walk through the door with some new jerk
And we had it good, and it hurts so bad
But I had to stand my ground
Chased my pride with another round

[Chorus]
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin’ new friends
I was growin’ up and nothin' made sense
Learnin’ how to live with a broken heart
I found myself in this bar

[Post Chorus]
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh

[Bridge]
Those nights, what I would give for one more
Bud Light, still kissin' on the front porch
Didn't even know what I was lookin' for

[Outro]
But I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this bar
Ain’t it a stranger thing you keep tucked in your heart
I found myself in this bar[Verse 1]
Dancin' in the kitchen, you singing my favorite songs
Swinging on the front porch, just laughing at the dogs
How you swear you love me more
When you're whisperin' goodnight
All those little moments are every reason why

[Chorus]
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feeling'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
Then I'm homesick for you

[Verse 2]
Well it says Kane Brown
On a sign with a line out the door
It sold out some little town
I've never been before
Yeah, they're screamin' my name
This is what we dreamed about
But out here singin' about you, baby, all I think about

[Chorus]
Is how I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the morning
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you

[Bridge]
Homesick for you
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes, just tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby, that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you
I'm homesick for you
Yeah, yeah[Verse 1]
Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country

[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

[Verse 2]
We turn the dirt and work until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

[Interlude]
(This is God's country)
God's country

[Bridge]
I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pinewood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country, I saw the light)
Yeah, I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin' (Yeah)
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country[Verse 1]
Seventeen, you don't think that much about life
You just live it
Like kerosene dancing around a fire
But you're in it

[Pre-Chorus]
So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Verse 2]
I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth living for
And a, old dusty hand-me-down six string
And a couple chords

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So sing along

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Outro]
She got the best of me
She got the best of me
She got the best of me[Verse 1]
Like a rainy Sunday mornin'
Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs

[Bridge]
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Verse 2]
You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah, I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Bridge]
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
You make it easy[Verse 1]
Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm

[Verse 2]
Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah
Mmm

[Bridge]
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace

[Chorus 2]
Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man
Mmm[Intro]
You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

[Verse 1]
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

[Chorus]
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Verse 2]
It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

[Chorus]
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

[Chorus]
Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love[Verse 1: Carly Pearce with Lee Brice]
It's all on me, it's my mistake
I said "I don't love you" a little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better

[Chorus: Carly Pearce & Lee Brice]
I hope you find what you were looking for
I hope your heart ain't hurting anymore
And you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now

[Verse 2: Lee Brice with Carly Pearce]
Who knew this heart could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warning
I thought that I was what you wanted

[Chorus: Lee Brice & Carly Pearce, Lee Brice]
Well I guess you found what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
And so I hope you're happy now

[Chorus: Carly Pearce & Lee Brice, Carly Pearce]
I hope you find what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
Hope you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
So I hope you're happy now

[Outro: Carly Pearce & Lee Brice, Lee Brice]
Happy now
Oh, I hope you're happy now
Mmm[Intro]
Ridin' roads
Ridin' roads

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah
This town ain't got no nightclub
We don't need the neon lights
Girl, I got that '87 gassed up
Thirty early out there in your drive
Got you a Bullet and a koozie, keep it ice cold
You take a sip 'fore we get gone
Lookin' at you with your hand out the window
I'm turnin' right while you're turnin' me on, yeah

[Chorus]
Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curb just to make you slide
The only light is a flashing yellow
Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this

[Post-Chorus]
Ridin' roads

[Verse 2]
Out there where the moon hits the water
Out there where your lips hit mine
I don't know where we are
'Cause somebody stole the street signs
I'ma take my sweet time, yeah
'Cause I could go on forever
With you there ridin' shotgun, yeah
All our friends are probably makin' plans, baby
Yeah, but we already got one
We'll be

[Chorus]
Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curb just to make you slide
The only light is a flashing yellow
Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this

[Post-Chorus]
Just ridin' roads on a night like this
Ridin' roads

[Bridge]
I got one hand on the wheel
And I got the other tryna cross the line, line, line
Yeah, the way you make feel
I wanna keep it rollin' 'til the sunri-ri-rise

[Chorus]
Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curb just to make you slide
The only light is a flashing yellow
The only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this (Oh)

[Post-Chorus]
Just ridin' roads on a night like this (Oh)
Ridin' roads[Verse 1]
Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Verse 3]
Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey hey mama rock me
Mama rock me
Mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
You can rock me
Rock me[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
What if this goes south, what if I mess you up?
You say what if I break your heart in two, then what?

[Pre-Chorus: Kane Brown]
Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Verse 2: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if the sky falls (Sky falls)
Or the sun stops burnin'?
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'
Or I could kiss you (You should kiss me)
What if you liked it? (Bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
Awe yeah
C'mon

[Bridge: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
Damn

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Outro: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
Away (Away)
What if?

[Chorus]
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

[Verse 2]
We used to live on Instagram
Worry 'bout who all gives a damn
'Bout where we've been and where we ended up
Then I met you and you met me
And all the rest is history
An epiphany that all we need is us

[Chorus]
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin', love, make a lot out of a little
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style, yeah
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin', love, make a lot out of a little
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be[Verse 1]
Hey, homecoming queen
Why do you lie?
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide?
Do people assume
You're always alright?
Been so good at smiling
Most of your life

[Pre-Chorus]
Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Does it get hard
To have to play the part?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya

[Chorus]
But what if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin?
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Oh

[Verse 2]
Hey, homecoming queen
How's things at home?
Still walking on eggshells
When that curtain's closed?
Did your Daddy teach you
How to act tough?
Or more like your Mama
Sweep it under the rug?

[Pre-Chorus]
Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Did you want the crown?
Or does it weigh you down?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya

[Chorus]
What if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin?
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Yeah, what if I told you the sky wouldn't fall?
If you lost your composure, said to hell with it all
Not everything pretty sparkles and shines
And even the homecoming queen cries (Ooh)
Oh yeah (Ooh)
Even the homecoming queen cries (Ooh)
Mmm-mmm, mmm (Ooh)

[Outro]
Hey, homecoming queen
Why do you lie?
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide?[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way[Verse 1: Jordan Davis]
So hold your head up, work the room
Smile like you ain't nervous (Nervous)
And be the life of every party with all your friends (Your friends)
Laugh it off, roll your eyes when they tell you that you're perfect
You can be that with all of them

[Chorus: Jordan Davis]
But you don't have to be cool anymore
Show me the side that nobody else knows
Drop that act with your keys at the door
Lose the mirrors, I see through the smoke (The smoke)
Save all that for the rest of the world
Come on, let me love you, girl
Don't you know that I'm already yours? (Already yours)
You don't have to be cool anymore
Cool anymore

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]
Puff your chest, crack a drink with your boys like you like to (Mmm)
And you internalize everything that's wrong, yeah (Uh)
But I know you when I know when we go home
You're slow dancin' in the kitchen with me all night long
I know you when I know when we're alone
You'll hold me better up, better than anyone

[Chorus: Jordan Davis & Julia Michaels]
You don't have to be cool anymore
Show me the side that nobody else knows
Drop that act with your keys at the door
Lose the mirrors, I see through the smoke
Save all that for the rest of the world
Come on, let me love you, girl
And don't you know that I'm already yours?
You don't have to be cool anymore
Cool anymore

[Bridge: Jordan Davis with Julia Michaels]
You can be anything to anyone
When the curtains close and the day is done
It's just us in the dark, baby, just be who you are

[Chorus: Jordan Davis & Julia Michaels, Julia Michaels]
You don't have to be cool anymore
Show me the side that nobody else knows
Drop that act with your keys at the door
Lose the mirrors, I see through the smoke (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Save all that for the rest of the world
Come on, let me love you, girl
Don't you know that I'm already yours? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You don't have to be cool anymore
Cool anymore

[Outro: Jordan Davis & Julia Michaels, Both]
You don't gotta be, don't gotta be
Cool anymore (Oh)
Cool anymore
You don't gotta be, don't gotta be, don't gotta be (Cool, cool)
Cool anymore
You don't gotta be, yeah, yeah
Cool anymore[Verse 1]
I'm jealous of the blue jeans that you're wearing
And the way they're holding you so tight
I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on staring
So lock the door and turn out the night

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself
To myself

[Verse 2]
I'm jealous of the song that you've been singing
And the way it's rolling off your lips
It might be selfish but I'm thinking
I don't need nothing between you
Leaning for another kiss, yeah

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah

[Bridge]
Girl, I want you in the worst way
Yeah, I want you in the worst way (Mmmm)

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else (No one else, baby)
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall (Paint the wall)
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark (Hide away in the dark)
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah[Verse 1]
I wasn't tryna feel like this
I wasn't tryna feel nothin' at all
I just came to meet my friends
And try to drink a long week off
I didn't want to stay too late
I wasn't tryna close it down
I was doin' my own thing
Yeah, up until you sat down

[Chorus]
I thought that I'd
Catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys, the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place
But then I saw your face
Now you got me tryna
Catch your eye, catch your name
Catch a spark and start a flame
The way you smile and I can't help myself
Girl, you got me tryna catch my breath
You got me tryna catch my breath, yeah

[Verse 2]
You got me doin' double-takes
You went and messed up all my plans
I only meant to hold this drink
Now I'm tryna hold your hand

[Chorus]
Yeah, I thought that I'd
Catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys, the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place
But then I saw your face
Now you got me tryna
Catch your eye, catch your name
Catch a spark and start a flame
The way you smile and I can't help myself
Girl, you got me tryna catch my breath, whoa
Ooh, you got me tryna catch my breath, whoa

[Bridge]
You got me catchin' feelin's
I wasn't even tryna feel this
I don't know how you started stealin'
My heart like you are in this bar
But I'm glad that you are

[Chorus]
'Cause I just thought that I'd
Catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys, the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place
But then I saw your face
Now you got me tryna
Catch your eye, catch your name
Catch a spark and start a flame
The way you smile and I can't help myself
Girl, you got me tryna catch my breath, oh
You got me tryna catch my breath, yeah
Ooh, you got me tryna catch my breath, whoa
You got me tryna catch my breath, whoa[Verse 1]
Girl you know I've known you forever
How many nights we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder
Making a motion like "'Could y'all get any closer?"
They wanna know what's up why I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over

[Chorus]
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true?
We make it true
Oh, we make it true

[Verse 2]
Well I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby
Or you could lay one on me right now
We could really give them something to talk about

[Chorus]
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true, baby?

[Bridge]
Oh be honest girl now
Do you want to do this or not?
Should we keep them talking, girl
Or should we just make them stop?

[Chorus]
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, and you feel it too
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
Whatd'you say we make it-
Make it true?
Whatd'you say we make it true?
Come on over here
Let's really give them something to talk about, baby
There's a rumor going round[Verse 1]
I can't wait to show you where I grew up
Walk you 'round the foothills of my town
Probably feel like you've been there before
After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
For six months now

[Verse 2]
We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church, because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off, but
I just thought that we should talk
A few things out before we hit the road

[Chorus]
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishin', but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

[Verse 3]
My sister's gonna ask a million questions
Say anything she can to turn you red
And when you meet my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights I can't outlive

[Chorus]
So if I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Buy you dinner, but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

[Bridge]
Oh
Mmh

[Chorus]
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She feels every heartache I go through
And if my dad sees me cryin'
He'll pour some whiskey over ice and
Tell a lie and say he never really liked you
Oh, if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine
You'll be breaking more hearts than mine[Verse 1]
First time I met you, knew I never could forget you, girl
You always saw the blue skies past the rain clouds in my eyes
There's music in your laughter from the floor up to the rafters
You're that happy ever after I've been after my whole life

[Chorus]
Who knows where I'd be without you?
No, I just couldn't be without you
I'll just say "Amen"
I can count 'em on one hand
But honey, look there on your finger
I'd say I'm a lucky man
God made two lovers out of strangers
A little house on a little land
A little creek, a little Jeep
Same old moon everybody sees
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings

[Verse 2]
Yesterday we celebrated our first year together
And together still feels better than that first night we met
I never dreamed that you could be so perfectly created, girl
He made a perfect angel
And he made you just for me

[Chorus]
Who knows where I'd be without you?
No, I just couldn't be without you
I'll just say "Amen"
I can count 'em on one hand
But honey, look there on your finger
I'd say I'm a lucky man
God made two lovers out of strangers
A little house on a little land
A little creek, a little Jeep
Same old moon everybody sees
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings

[Outro]
No, I can't count 'em on both hands
But honey, look here at this picture
I'd say we're a lucky fam
I'm thankful to be with you
A little house on a little land
Couple kids, two or three
Same old song that we'll always sing
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings
Always take time to count your blessings[Verse 1]
She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', "no way she ain't got one"
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "come here, boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Verse 2]
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

[Chorus 2]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is"
She was like, "come here boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Bridge]
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

[Chorus 3]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "come here boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Outro]
Yeah play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody play it again, play it again, play it again[Verse 1]
We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down a coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes
Come to think, I miss them all
And damn, babe, it's all your fault

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Verse 2]
Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God, I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my)
Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Bridge]
Don't you remember Times Square?
And people counting down everywhere
2000-whatever, no, I didn't care
'Cause baby you were there
And once again, couldn't help but stare

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah, you guessed it, girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you

[Outro]
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you[Verse 1]
Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

[Chorus]
I’m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Verse 2]
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

[Chorus]
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Bridge]
Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice

[Chorus]
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away, away, away
Yeah I'm still one number away[Verse 1]
If it's Friday you know I'll be
Kickin' back with the boys down at Santa's pub
But don't hesitate, don't even think about waiting, nah just type it up
Yeah, I'm ready if you're ready or wonderin'
Stop thinking, hit send

[Chorus]
Doesn't matter if it's last call from a late night sidewalk
A little too buzzed, a little too drunk
You could have your hair down, all curled up on the couch
And the quiet ain't loud enough, nah
It could be A.M. or P.M.  
It could be middle of the week or the weekend, baby
It ain't too late or too far
Just call me 'cause I'm lonely
If you are, if you are
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are
If you are, if you are, yeah
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are

[Verse 2]
If it's Monday and it's over
You know the show your girls all come over for
And the red wine's getting lower
And your last friend's out the door
When there's no more roses to go around
Hit me up girl, you know I'm down

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if it's last call from a late night sidewalk
A little too buzzed, a little too drunk
You could have your hair down, all curled up on the couch
And the quiet ain't loud enough, nah
It could be A.M. or P.M.  
It could be middle of the week or the weekend, baby
It ain't too late or too far
Just call me 'cause I'm lonely
If you are, if you are
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are
If you are, if you are
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are

[Bridge]
Oh, let me love the lonely right out of you
Oh, let me love the lonely right out of you
Oh yeah, if you're out there and lonely, girl, I'm lonely, too
So let me love the lonely right out of you

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if it's last call from a late night sidewalk
Little too buzzed, a little too drunk
You could have your hair down, all curled up on the couch
And the quiet ain't loud enough, no
It could be A.M. or P.M.  
It could be middle of the week or the weekend, baby
It ain't too late or too far
Just call me 'cause I'm lonely
If you are, if you are, yeah
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are
If you are, if you are, yeah
Oh, I'm lonely if you are[Verse 1]
Girl, I’ve always loved you, but something’s changed
Blame it on time, the road or the ride, but it ain’t the same
It’s a different kind of feeling, not the one I knew
From the sweet on your lips, to how your hand in mine fits
Girl I’ve always loved you but

[Chorus]
I don’t love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It’s stronger the longer I’m with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn’t know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby I do, I don’t love you like I used to, no

[Verse 2]
What we got ain’t got no ending, like a band of solid gold
It’s sweeter with time like strawberry wine, it gets as good as it gets old
And oh, we thought we knew what it meant back then
But I keep fallin' all in higher than I’ve ever been, oh no, oh

[Chorus]
I don’t love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It’s stronger the longer I’m with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn’t know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby I do, I don’t love you like I used to, no

[Break]
Oh no
Oh no, no-no

[Chorus]
I don’t love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It’s stronger the longer I’m with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn’t know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby I do, I don’t love you like I used to, no

[Outro]
Oh, oh
I don’t love you like I used to
Oh, oh, no
Love you like I used to
Love you like I used to, yeah
Oh, I don’t love you like I used to


[Verse 1]
Hah, yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-You collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (On it) (Yeah)
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to—

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Verse 2]
I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (Wasn't)
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (Was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should'a let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Bridge]
Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kami, kami-kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze (kamikaze)
Take a look at what I've done

[Verse 3]
I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift, beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is
Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a foot—oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (What?), 12 inches of wood (Haha)
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words
You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray-on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot[Intro: Eminem & Justin Vernon]
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (Look)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, "He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit"
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, "Hold your head up!"—Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)—Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a f*****, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (Ha), sorry if I took forever (Ha-ha)

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Ha)
Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word to everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall… bitch (Yeah)

[Outro: Justin Vernon]
It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire[Intro]
Nobody pray for me
It's been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah!)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Bitch, be humble (Hol’ up, bitch)

[Verse 2]
Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

[Chorus]
Bitch, be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (Hol' up, bitch)

Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real

I apologize a trillion times

[Bridge: André 3000]
Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on
You say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever??
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real

I apologize a trillion times

"Look at the way he treats me"
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
‘Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

Rip every beat I get on, I was made to (I was made to)

I know I'm the man, baby, bring your friends with you
Puttin' points up while you in the stands, nigga
But I be stuck in these streets, you in the background
Ever since they took my brother, gotta pack rounds
Sorry momma, two bails, took a bad route
I done got my bands up, a nigga stacked now
But we been still O.T. on that bullshit (On that bullshit)
I don't wanna have to do it, empty full clips (Empty full clips)
Why these niggas talkin' robbin', they don't do shit
High Cali niggas tapped in, we'll cook shit
Bust down on my neck, niggas reach, gettin' stretched
Rockin' with this TEC, niggas better wear a vest
Last year, I was broke, young nigga in the Crest
Now a show 20 or better, broke niggas keep the rest

Lil nigga think he cut, yeah, I bet the nigga freeze
If that nigga want me dead, I can't let that nigga breathe
Want me gone, sent a shot, like the real kind
These niggas actin' like they tough when they real kind
Thumbin' through a 100 racks just to kill time
They got a nigga at the edge, but I feel fine
But it come with this shit, I'm okay with it
If your man's to his last share a plate wit' 'em
One whole wood to the neck, it's an eighth in it
New baby chop, let it sing, it's a Drake nigga
A lot of shit on my mind make me think a lot
Why it's hard for me to smile? 'Cause I seen a lot
You ain't really in the field, you just tweet a lot
If we ain't on the same page, you can kick a rock, bitch!

[Verse 4: Yhung T.O. & Kendrick Lamar]
And I been really tryna keep the peace
But I'm a north Vallejo nigga, and I'm heavy in the streets
I was raised by my grannie and the gangsters
So at 8 I made the choice I'ma forever be a G, and
I don't really like to talk
I remember we was broke and I don't really like to walk, nigga
Now I ride around in foreign cars
And I put on for my team who was with me from the start, nigga
I don't play games, stitch lip, I don't say names
She want a dog, I'm a Great Dane
I got great aim, Ice Age on my damn chain
My momma told me keep a stash for the damn rain
They ain't wanna see me win 'cause I'm black
So I pulled up in that all black Benz in the back
If you need someone to call, I'm the man for the task
You ain't standin' for the cause, meet the man in the mask[Intro]

Hermès link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I fuck yo bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo ho if yo bitch keep eyein' me

Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah

[Verse 2]
I'ma explain why you probably never seen me
I'm in a sunken place, no Instagram, I'm watchin' TV
I think I trade my breakfast, lunch, and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me
Put 'em in a Jersey shore like Pauly D

[Chorus]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Get away from me, if I was you, I'd watch what you say to me
Snakes all in my bed, wanna lay with me?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game, why you play with me?
Don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love

[Verse 1]
Look, I love it when they count me out, I'm a soldier (I'm a soldier)
Love when they think I ain't cool 'cause I'm sober ('Cause I'm sober)
You used to love when we was down, we was closer (Yeah, yeah)
But I stopped lovin' ever since I got fucked over
Ho, don't call me, I don't know ya
You gotta keep that same energy (Energy)
I'm not no regular entity (Woo)
I'm not your friend, I'm your enemy (Enemy)
I don't know what's gotten into me
Lately, I'm just feelin' finicky
Lately, I just want the cake and the greatest amenities
Lately, I ain't got no sympathy, aim at the industry
This ain't the way that they pictured me, what's your identity?
I guess I'm linin' 'em up
I keep my nine in the trunk (Bang)
All of y'all niggas gon' bleed (Bleed)
Guess it's that time of the month
I done came up from the mud
They said I'd never be nothin', they said I'd never be rich
They said I'd never be anything, I told 'em, "Get off my dick"

[Chorus]
Get away from me, if I was you, I'd watch what you say to me
Snakes all in my bed, wanna lay with me?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game, why you play with me?
Don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love...

[Verse 2]
Yo, I love days they say I couldn't eat when I fell (Yeah)
On the streets with no help (Word)
Money ain't everything (Woo)
Nigga, speak for yourself (Ayy)
Pawn shops every week (Week)
Scrapin' change, pay the bills (Yeah)
Rainy days, couldn't sleep (Word)
Now I sleep with my grills (Joyner)
I wanted to be like Hov (Woo)
I'm livin' la vida loc' (Loc')
They jus' wanna ride my wave (Woo)
You ain't never seen my boat (Splash)
Hit 'em with the Eastside smoke
I'ma kill everyone, I'm a G.I. Joe
Hidin' my weapons all in my Levi's coat
If a nigga was pimpin', you'd prolly be my ho (Woo)
I need some different opponents ('Ponents)
I think I live in the moment (Yeah)
I fuck my bitch in the mornin' (Joyner)
I take that shit when I want it (True)
All you new niggas be frontin'
You just be lyin', I keep it 300
Came up from nothin', I say what I want
And no, ain't no discussion, I aim and I bust

[Chorus]
Get away from me, if I was you, I'd watch what you say to me
Snakes all in my bed, wanna lay with me?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game, why you play with me?
Don't play with me, this the only thing

[Verse 1: Mikey]
Spot a little hottie when I flipped out the shade
Lookin' like a red Rari sittin' in a driveway
Bottle of Cîroc with a hint of Kool-Aid
She done pulled up like I'm getting rid of weeds
Are you tired from running through my mind?
Take a break and we can have a good time
Show you moves like I'm the new James Brown
Me and you should get a room right now

[Pre-Chorus: Mikey]
'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away
You're worth more than every single chain
It ain't gon' work if you don't want it to
Best drink I take is when I'm sippin' you

[Chorus: Mikey]
You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classy, come through with that magic
You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true

[Verse 2: Mikey]
I can take you to the room or I can take you to the beach
But we gotta leave at 9 'cause I gotta get my sleep
You can be the early bird, I'ma give you that worm
Get with me, I'll take you 'round the world

[Pre-Chorus: Mikey]
'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away
You're worth more than every single chain
Walk with a limp, it just means I'm cool
Next trip I take, it's just me and you

[Chorus: Mikey]
You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classy, come through with that magic
You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat
You said you livin' up north when you comin' to the A
You said you need to find a crib, well, tell me where you wanna stay
I know we're not too pressed for time but can you pick up on the pace
I'm tired of looking at your pictures, wanna be up in your face
I wanna dance with you, I wanna laugh, I wanna sing
Take you on the road, have you rockin' on my bling
Don't know if you're the one, but if you are, you'll get a ring
That's later down the line, don't wanna rush these types of things
I'm a mama's boy so you gotta meet my mama first
As you whip the Coupe around, just use the seat belt first
New shoes, new clothes and a Chanel purse
Vacaying in The Hamptons got a lazy curse
Lil Boat

[Chorus: Mikey]
You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classy, come through with that magic
You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true[Chorus: Kid Cudi]

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Very rarely do you catch me out
Y'all done "specially invited guest"'d me out
Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out
Soon as I walk in, I'm like, "Let's be out"
I was off the chain, I was often drained
I was off the meds, I was called insane
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame
I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame
Cardio audio, let me jog your brain
Caught in the Audy Home, we was all detained
All of you Mario, it's all a game

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I had my issues, ain't that much I could do
Peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me)
At times, wonder my purpose
Easy than to feel worthless
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me, with me)
Had so much on my mind, I didn't know where to go
I've come a long way from them hauntin' me
Had me feelin' oh so low
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
Oh, things ain't like before
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
No stress yes, I'm so blessed and-

Really couldn't find my way out (Keep movin' forward)
Of the storm (Keep movin' forward)
Which way do I go?

Come on y'all, let's take a ride
Don't ya say shit just get inside
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
Cuz you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip
Grab you gat with the extra clip
And close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it, kick it, kick it
Yea that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin, ain't no crippin
Ain't no punk ass niggas set trippin'
Everybody got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black
I wanna take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank, and I know that I can bring ya
If ya can't take the heat get ya ass out the kitchen
We on a mission

[Hook]
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I'm hittin switches on the block in a 65
Come along and ride on fantastic voyage
Slide, slide hoo ride, ain't no valley low enough or mountain high

[Verse 2: Coolio]
I'm tryin to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside without livin in fear of a drive by
And even if I get away from them drive by killaz
I still gotta worry about those snitch ass niggas
I keep on searchin' and I keep on lookin'
But niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be actin' like they evil
You don't understand about runnin' with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang
And you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

[Hook]
Come along and ride on a Fantastic Voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I do what I do just to survive
(Come along and ride on a Fantastic Voyage)
Slide slide hoo ride, that's why I pack my 45

[Verse 3: Coolio]
Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Every game ain't the same cause the game still remain
Don't it seem kinda strange ain't a damn thing changed
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down ass niggas can ride with me
Hip hop hop your 45 quickly down the block
Stay sucker free and keep the busters of your jock
You gotta have heart son if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot, swing low
Ain't nobody crying ain't nobody dyin'
Ain't nobody worryin' everybody's tryin'
Nothing from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you wanna have somethin' you better stop frontin'
What you gonna do when the 5 rolls by?
You better be ready so you can ride

[Hook]
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity slide if you're living in the city it's do or die

Do you want to ride with me? (x9)[Verse 1]
I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gon' plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera]
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages

[Verse 2]
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

She watched that "Walker Texas Ranger," say I remind her of Nas X

They like girls and I like girls, three at a time, sometimes four
And if my backend not all hundreds and ain't on time, then I don't go

I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)

I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I swear this industry shit, to me, is one big-ass lick
I walk inside of a buildin', tell the A&R nigga "strip"
Tell 'em I need all of my chips, my life been on Section 8
I've been a welfare case, AFDC pump fake
Meanwhile, I'm grindin' 'cause drug money ain't like rap money
Four white kilo, snow-bunny, equal one whole show, dummy
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up
I got a bad call, they killed Braze
They killed Chad, my big homie Pup
Puppy eyes on my face, bruh
And I really be drinkin', why the fuck I really been smokin'?
What the fuck? I'm the sober one
Man, I'm so stressed out, I can't focus
Hide out when I ride out, ski mask with the eyes out
Speed past in the Cutlass, me and little Ocho
Every young nigga hop out
Two tears in a bucket, I feel like "fuck it"
The price of fame, recognize my pain, it's all I know
All out war but I'm out here though
Call my troops like, "vamonos"
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up
I got a bad call, and it's all bad
Off a OG with my OG and some OE by the tall glass

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
You can't expect the unexpected, these dreams are manifested
From my head into reality, they seems a bit excessive
But I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings
All the times that I've been reckless with an ego big as Texas
Thinkin' "I'm the man", I never let these hoes inside the plan
My room for bullshit in the crib as small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk a path where only giants stand
I am the fire man, shit I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone, on the road
Even though I know they need me at home
Keep my control from a city where it's freezin' and cold
Each to their own, punches like this probably beat up Stallone

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
Wow, niggas been crampin' my style
Blowin' my high, they want a reply
The number one question is, "How?"
How does it feel now that you on?
How much you worth? How big is your home?
How come you won't get a few features?
I think you should? How 'bout I don't?
How 'bout you just get the fuck off my dick?
How 'bout you listen and never forget?
Only gon' say this one time, then I'll dip
Niggas ain't worthy to be on my shit
Haven't you heard? I'm as cold as the tip
Tip of the iceberg that tipped the Titanic
No tip-toein' around it, my shit is gigantic
As big as the fuckin' Atlantic, I'm lit, bitch

[Verse 6: Joyner Lucas]
Niggas want war, but it ain't likely
Boy, you know, threats I don't take lightly
Better have hands if you gon' fight me
Got a quick left jab and that shit's light-speed
Niggas say I'm next up and I just might be
Started from the bottom they ain't know a lot about him
All I had was Ramen noodles and a little iced tea
Now my life's like a movie, motherfuckin' Spike Lee
I just want canaries on my wristwatch, yeah
Niggas get buried in the slipknot, woah
Shorty think I'm married, but my dick's not, uh
I ain't get married 'til my dick drop, yeah
I just wanna hit it in some flip flops, woah
I don't want kids, I don't lip-lock, no
If you want love, better kick rocks, yeah

Why the fuck I need a loan for police to leave me alone?
Once you makin' provolone, they think you sellin' from your home
Motherfuck these maricóns, excuse me, I'm not bashin' shit
I open safes like open sesame now there ain't no cash in it
Crash the whip like I'm Crash Bandicoot then get my bands a coupe
Bands are blue from what they hand to you, my guap is tangible
Sayin' to you, "My shit's phenomenal, I'm a phenomenon"
Back in the days, my boys was starvin' and it wasn't Ramadan
Octagon, if it's about my feet then the boy get dropped
If it's paper over pussy, best believe everything gon' pop
When I walk into the building now, it's open the close-up shop
When I— (Monster, You get in my way, I'ma )
Ashley Banks, Carlton Banks, Hilary Banks robbin' a bank
Outta your league, outta your rank, wanna be us but niggas can't
I know your girl, she just a skank, you got a gun, I got a tank
All this shit random but I gotta thank
All of my niggas for breakin' the bank, bitch

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm fittin' to kill 'em and dumpin' their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
Or be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blown up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo!"
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines ("Slim, you're old")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
"Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery," oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write "Not Alike"
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

[Outro]
You fuckin'—oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you[Chorus: Childish Gambino & Janet Leon]
Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And when they hear us on the beat
All they wanna do is make hits
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'
How the world should be: perfectly
Fire like I’m third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high
Firefly

[Verse 1]
Skateboardin' down at Washington Square
Lookin' for quarters
Maybe afford a falafel for dinner, uh
I’m so broke man, scholarship apologin'
Facebook messages from college kids who hollerin'
Girls like, "We love you, we go to LSU,"
"You gotta do a show so we can come and molest you!"
This rap stuff is magic
I used to get called "Oreo" and "faggot"
I used to get more laughs when I got laughed at
"Oh, you got a mixtape? That's fantastic!"
But everybody thought it was jokes though
They half right, the joke is
I got flow so don't act like
You ain't sittin' there with your friends like, it can't be
I know Donald Glover, he weak man, he campy
I'm still knocked down, but I up the ante
Me and hip-hop, that black Sid and Nancy, let 'em know

[Chorus: Childish Gambino & Janet Leon]

[Verse 2]
It's hard to make Hov the footsteps you followin'
Especially when your niggas look like Carlton
The pretty girls usin' skin so soft
Only be likin' black dudes with their hats broke off
Nigga, you act too soft
Fuck you! I'm from the projects
My mom was just workin' to give me options
No live shows, cause I can't find sponsors
For the only black kid at a Sufjan concert
"Yeah, so, whatcha gonna do man?
You don't speak to the hood, man"
If I was given one chance I think I could, man
These black kids want somethin' new, I swear it
Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't cause they embarrassed
All I do is make the stuff I would've liked
Reference things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite
Now I'm firefly like a burning kite
And you's a fake fuck like a fleshlight
Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy
Like, how the hell he drop a EP and meet JAY-Z?
Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough
Now text me pics sayin', "You could tear this up!"
I don't really like shades, big rims, or jewelry
But gettin' time of day from a model is new to me
Bein' me isn't as hard as it used to be
Now everyone sing the chorus man, you do it so beautifully

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, "Stick it!"
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down

Grow your beard out, just weird out

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vinyls

[Scratch]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)
Word, Rick? Word, man, you heard
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Bridge]
I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (Love of my life)

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

Everybody say that I gotta be stopped (Stopped)
Even though my final form ain't unlocked (Locked)

How you comprehend what you ain't understandin'?
Count a hundred bands and I watch it vanish
Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothin' I can't handle

[Pre-Chorus]
Flavor lasts forever, you should try a sample (Goddamn)

Never know when someone comes and tries to take my life
I've been sleepin' with the .45 like every night
In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got "Malone" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you
More people wanna be you, don't trust no one

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

[Verse 2]
Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden
Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in
I don't ever sleep, yeah, I'm wide awake
If you try to pull up to my place
Beam is gonna hit you a mile away
I promise, one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky
No, he can't escape the eyes
Politicians and the lies
Tell me, what's the point in pickin' sides?

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

[Bridge]
(Ayy) Mind is runnin' all day
Cost me more than money and I'm payin' the price, yeah
I ain't goin' nowhere
Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah
Minute after minute, never had a limit
Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it
Windows always tinted, you ain't lookin' in it
Either way, I know they'll come for me again

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace[Intro]
Ahahah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
When you leave me, make me jump up off my roof
Didn't faze you, would've given you the moon
Even after everything that we've been through
I ain't never met nobody like you
Why you always tryna tell me that it's cool?
Need to quiet 'cause you never tell the truth
Felt like ballin' was the only thing to do
Trade my woman for some diamonds and a coupe

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change, yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah

And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, yeah, yeah
Just to show you that it's over
It don't matter what you gotta say about it, yeah
I'ma put that bitch pussy in a motherfuckin' bodybag
So you know that I'm never ever coming back
You kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah
I was an idiot
Beggin' on my knees onto the floor
Now, I don't even want you anymore, anymore
It's over now
It's over now, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 2]
Feels like a knife in my throat, you treat this like it's a joke
I bet you've done this before, I ain't surprised, yeah
I wasn't tryna let go, but you'll know why when I'm ghost
I hope you wind up alone, dead in my eyes, yeah
Ain't religious, only Christian when it's Dior
Only prayin' for the Amex and the gold
You ain't stop me, no, you only was a detour
Tried to drive me crazy, you ran out of road

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change (Is gonna change), yeah, ayy

So you know that I'm never ever coming back (Never coming back)
You kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag (In a Prada bag)
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah
I was an idiot
Beggin' on my knees on to the floor (To the floor)
Now I don't even want you anymore, anymore

Memories
Don't you ever let them fool you
Don't you ever let them fool you

I learned the hard way about trust, about us, about us
You shouldn’t be on your high horse, we’re not so stable anymore

I wanna feel like I can't come down
I got a dream so I can’t stop now
I wanna, I wanna fly right now
I wanna see all my homies get down
I wanna feel like I can't come down
I got a dream so I can't stop now
I gotta stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest thing is believing in your dreams
Stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest thing is believing in your dreams

[Post-Chorus]
I feel like a stranger to myself
And sometimes that feels dangerous but I’ll bet you'll see me
For who I truly am, maybe not if it wasn't bland
Some days I look in mirrors and I wonder who's that man
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah

[Verse]
All my people gather 'round, I'm here to inspire (True)
If you runnin' on E, I'll put the fire in your lighter (Yeah)
Black Hollywood never started and it’s over
People only care when you’re Denzel or Oprah (Yeah)
Kosher, holster, make my homies bolder (Woo)
When your fear's near, you don’t wanna get closer (No)
Rappers sound the same so they chains gettin' colder (Yeah)
Women, claim your boy for some credit and some doja (Hey)
Hold up, that's just how we make it (Yeah)
Black never breaks so your patience gotta face it (Damn)
Know my life matter, but my matter keep on achin' (True)
This a warning, never conforming (No)

[Chorus]
I wanna fly right now
I wanna see all my homies get down
I wanna feel like I can’t come down

I wanna feel like I can't come down
I got a dream so I can't stop now
I gotta stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest thing is believing in your dreams
Stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest feeling is believing in your dreams

[Outro]
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah[Chorus 1]
I been waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you
One hundred bottles of the good shit couldn't even bring you back
What am I to do?
Feel like I'm circlin' a drain, all I see is the remains of an ugly truth (Of an ugly truth)
One hundred models I could follow all the way to hell and back, but they can't replace you (They can't replace you)

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh

[Verse 1]
I was puttin' on for you like a jersey
What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me
Never thought that you'd go and do me dirty
Left me in the cold, but on the inside I was burnin'
But that's just the way it goes
Wish that I could have control
Everybody dies alone
(And I ain't dead yet)

[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

[Chorus 2]
I'm still waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you (Take me right to you)
One hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back
What am I to do? (What am I to do?)
You’re my alibi and motive when I'm lyin' to myself, what an ugly truth (What an ugly truth)
We’re no strangers to the flame
We will never be the same if we make it through (And we can make it through)

[Verse 2]
My back is up against the wall
But I used to feel invincible
Yeah, it was us against the world
But somehow, someway, the tables turned
I remember back then
Played my cards right you were my best hand
Still you keep me guessin'
Wonder if I'll ever get the message

[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

[Outro]
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm not scared of the dark
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall
I'm not scared, not at all
Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?
I'm not scared
I'm not scared, neither are the stars
I'm not scared of the dark
Of the dark, mmm

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi
I ain't never scared and I ain't never horrified
I just look down at my Rolex, it said it's the darkest times
I ain't never terrified, I ain't never petrified
You know I see dead people, I just tell 'em, "Get a life"
I ain't never scurred, I'm not sure if that's a word, but
I mean every word, feelin' like "do not disturb," wait
Let me testify, I have never testified
And I'm married to my pride, I ain't never, never cried
I got eyes like marbles, if I cry they sparkle
You know I can read your mind like I'm the author
There's a line for tomorrow and that line's gettin' shorter
I'm behind the trigger, what if I am the target?
Deep sigh, a sayōnara, I ain't afraid to die
It's either goodbye or good mornin', and the skies start to fallin'
And I'ma shine in the darkness
I look back down at my Rollie, it says "Time for the chorus"
You know I'm not scared

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Lil Wayne]
I'm not scared of the dark
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared, not at all
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared, neither are the stars
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared of the dark

Of the dark, mmm

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yuh
Okay, put my heart to the side
In my feelings, ***, let's ride

She might get a new Mercedes
She say she want me, oowee
Okay, lil' shawty, let's do this, come on

If I could count the tears I've cried
A million times, I swear I've died

The only time I want her is tonight

There's love at my front door, short notice
She not like the sane girls, I noticed

Life is not the same with your pictures in my frame
Now that you're here, I want nothing to change
You pick me up when I'm down, I need you around
You seen me through my darkest times
Girl, is there something that you try to find?
You brought meaning to my life
All because of you, I do right
Because of you, I have a purpose
Fight for the world because you're worth it

Got a devil on my left and a angel on my right
I'm just tryna live my life, I'm just hangin' in the fight (Yuh)
Swingin' off the web of life, glidin' through the breeze (Breeze)
My uncle always told me that it never would be easy (Nah)
Now I'm lookin' to the sky hoping that he rest in peace
Violence in the streets, I just wanna calm the beast
All these problems I'm just fightin' with myself and enemies
Looking for my peace while I'm (Looking for my peace while I'm)

I just wanna swing and fly away (Fly away)
I just wanna see a better day (Better day)

Very rarely do you catch me out
Y'all done "specially invited guest"'d me out
Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out
Soon as I walk in, I'm like, "Let's be out"
I was off the chain, I was often drained
I was off the meds, I was called insane
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame
I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame
Cardio audio, let me jog your brain
Caught in the Audy Home, we was all detained
All of you Mario, it's all a game

I had my issues, ain't that much I could do
Peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me)
At times, wonder my purpose
Easy than to feel worthless
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me, with me)
Had so much on my mind, I didn't know where to go
I've come a long way from them hauntin' me
Had me feelin' oh so low
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
Oh, things ain't like before
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
No stress yes, I'm so blessed and-

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You found another— better one

OH I HEARD YOUR LOOKING FOR LOVE IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES AND YOU GET STUCK WITH ALL THE WRONG GAZES
BUT GIRL I’MMA SHOW YOU HOW TO REVERSE THE PAIN WITH AN OLD SCHOOL SOUND

To remove them jeans
Let me show you how
How we get down
I'll keep this blunt
I'mma hit it like a blunt[Verse 1]
I'm not the best at showing my emotions
You cut me deep and you left me wide open
I fought the demons that lie in between us
They'd think we're perfect if they'd ever seen us, but
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

[Chorus]
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada

[Verse 2]
I took the time to think of what you said
You were tap-dancing in my head
I must be honest, I have a lot of pride
But I'm broken inside
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

[Chorus]
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning

Woke up a little too late this morning
But I think I'll be okay

Damn, my car still smells like marijuana
My mom is gonna kill me

Traffic's backed up from corner to corner
So I guess I'll hit the highway
The highway
Shake away all the stress off my shoulders
Gonna have a good day
A good day

[Chorus]
Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours

[Verse 2]
No I've never really been the smartest
Yeah I've made my mistakes
My mistakes
You were there when times were at their darkest
Always showing me the way
Lead the way
Your love seems to cut me deep, the sharpest
You'll always have a part of me
A part of me
Losing you has always been the hardest
I wish it were the old days (oh I wish it were the old days)

[Chorus]
'Cause I was eighteen
And I still lived with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours were more understanding
I never fell in love

Before we turn the page so many quotes that I like
You inspire so much that I write

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Bridge]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Outro]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter (Fighter)
'Cause all my life, I've been fighting
Never felt a feeling of comfort, oh
And all this time, I've been hiding
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence

[Chorus]
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

[Drop]
I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long

[Verse 2]
I'm in need of a savior (Savior), but I'm not asking for favors
My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence

[Chorus]
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

[Drop]
I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long[Verse 1: Khalid]
Tell me what you're crying for
I'll wipe your tears, oh love
If your soul is aching love
I'll comfort you for sure
If we're caught in a wave
I will carry you over
It don't matter where you are
I'll run to your front door

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm 100 with you

[Chorus: Khalid]
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could put an

[Drop: Khalid]
Between our love, love, love, love, love
You could put an
Between our love, love, love, love, love
You could put an ocean

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Shadows play on idle hands
I lose myself I do
But I've found my way to velvet sands
I'll crash right into you
If we're caught in a wave
I will carry you over
It don't matter where we are
You're still the one I choose

[Chorus: Khalid]
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could put an

[Drop: Khalid]
Between our love, love, love, love, love
You could put an
Between our love, love, love, love, love
You could put an ocean[Verse 1: Jamie Scott]
Light 'em up, light 'em up
Tell me where you are, tell me where you are
The summer nights, the bright lights
And the shooting stars, they break my heart

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jamie Scott]
I'm calling you now, but you're not picking up
Your shadows so close if you are still in love
Then light a match, light a match
Baby, in the dark, show me where you are

[Chorus: Jamie Scott]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day when I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away

[Post-Chorus: Jamie Scott]
So far away

[Verse 2: Romy Dya]
It's breaking me, I'm losing you
We were far from perfect, but we were worth it
Too many fights, and we cried, but never said we're sorry
Stop saying you love me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Romy Dya]
You're calling me now, but I can't pick up
Your shadow's too close, and I'm still in love
The summer's over now, but somehow, it still breaks my heart
We could have had the stars, oh

[Chorus: Jamie Scott & Romy Dya / Jamie Scott]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day when I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away

[Post-Chorus: Romy Dya /  Romy Dya & Jamie Scott]
So far away
So far away
Oh, so far away
So far away

[Outro: Romy Dya]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day when I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day when you're so far away[Letra de "Shawn Mendes - Youth ft. Khalid (Traducción al Español)"]

[Verse 1: Mikey]
Spot a little hottie when I flipped out the shade
Lookin' like a red Rari sittin' in a driveway
Bottle of Cîroc with a hint of Kool-Aid
She done pulled up like I'm getting rid of weeds
Are you tired from running through my mind?
Take a break and we can have a good time
Show you moves like I'm the new James Brown
Me and you should get a room right now

[Pre-Chorus: Mikey]
'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away
You're worth more than every single chain
It ain't gon' work if you don't want it to
Best drink I take is when I'm sippin' you

[Chorus: Mikey]
You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classy, come through with that magic
You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true

[Verse 2: Mikey]
I can take you to the room or I can take you to the beach
But we gotta leave at 9 'cause I gotta get my sleep
You can be the early bird, I'ma give you that worm
Get with me, I'll take you 'round the world

[Pre-Chorus: Mikey]
'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away
You're worth more than every single chain
Walk with a limp, it just means I'm cool
Next trip I take, it's just me and you

[Chorus: Mikey]
You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classy, come through with that magic
You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat
You said you livin' up north when you comin' to the A
You said you need to find a crib, well, tell me where you wanna stay
I know we're not too pressed for time but can you pick up on the pace
I'm tired of looking at your pictures, wanna be up in your face
I wanna dance with you, I wanna laugh, I wanna sing
Take you on the road, have you rockin' on my bling
Don't know if you're the one, but if you are, you'll get a ring
That's later down the line, don't wanna rush these types of things
I'm a mama's boy so you gotta meet my mama first
As you whip the Coupe around, just use the seat belt first
New shoes, new clothes and a Chanel purse
Vacaying in The Hamptons got a lazy curse
Lil Boat

[Chorus: Mikey]
You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classy, come through with that magic
You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true[Verse 1]
What if, what if we run away?
What if, what if we left today?
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?
And what if, what if we're hard to find?
What if, what if we lost our minds?
What if we let them fall behind and they're never found?

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof

[Chorus]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

[Verse 2]
What if, what if we start to drive?
What if, what if we close our eyes?
What if we're speeding through red lights into paradise?
Cause we've no time for getting old
Mortal body; timeless souls
Cross your fingers, here we go

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof

[Chorus]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
My youth is yours
My youth is yours[Verse 1]
Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

I'm tryna see you from my own perspective
You all in my section tryna come to my session
We rollin' up pressure, you know that we flexin'
We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl this a confession, I'm not like your exes

You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'

From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autos

[Verse 1]
Huh, yeah
I'm keepin' it real, real
I'm keepin' it real, uh, yeah
Life gets tough, shit is getting real (Yeah)
I don't know how to feel
Swallowing all these pills
Numb my real feels, uh
Devil standing here
Tryna' make a deal, uh
It ain't no deals
Feel like I'm going crazy but still took a lot to get me here
Losing my sanity up in a house in the hills, hills, hills
I ain't have anything then and I still don't have anything still, still, still, uh
Bein' me, I rock, PnB
These hoes actin' like gossip, TMZ
These drugs acting like
Mosh pits squishing me
Oh my, oh me, how they kill me slowly
Lonely, I been gettin' no peace
OD, feel like overdosing
Low key I been looking for the signs
But all I can find is a sign of the times

[Verse 2]
I ain't suicidal
Only thing suicide is suicide doors
Fight for survival
Gotta keep hope up, rolling good dope up (Uh)
Hold my hand, through hell we go
Don't look back, it ain't the past no more
Gonna get to the racks, all them niggas want war
Yeah, I was put here to lead the lost souls
Exhale depression as the wind blows
These are the laws of livin' in vogue
We're perfectly imperfect children
Rose from the dust, all of us are on a mission
Never gave a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now we live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'
I don't give a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now I live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'

I just wanted you to treat me like a baby
And spend every single moment with me daily, daily
Now you callin' me needy
Cuz you gotta work five times weekly

Existed

[Outro]
Hovey Benjamin made this beat

[Verse 1]
All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
Oh, I gotta ask

[Chorus]
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind (oh)

[Verse 2]
I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

[Chorus]
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind

[Bridge]
Let's get lost tonight (oh)
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]

Power
Got me sittin' by my phone, I’ve been waiting for hours
On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place (Mmm, nah)
It’s crowded
In LA, but I’ll be there at 8 if the traffic allows it
Say you’re down, I could show you around
If you’re really about it, yeah
But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?
What do you say?

[Chorus]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Verse 2]
Saved
Got the weed, we can sit by the beach if we wanna get faded
But if that's not the vibe, yeah, it’s cool
We can save it for later, yeah
I just like the way it feels when you're around
When you're around, ah
Now I know we're not dating, nah
Maybe soon by the way things go, we’ve been talking for ages
Take it step by step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, love
If the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out
It'll all work out, yeah

[Chorus]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Chorus]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night

Go ahead and bark after dark
Fallen star, I'm your one call away
Motel halls, neon walls
When night falls, I am your escape

[Pre-Chorus]
When you lay alone, I ache
Something I wanted to feel

[Chorus]
If you’ve been waitin' for fallin' in love
Babe, you don’t have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

[Verse 2]
Not anyone, you're the one
More than fun, you're the sanctuary
'Cause what you want is what I want
Sincerity

[Pre-Chorus]
Souls that dream alone lie awake
I’ll give you somethin’ so real

[Chorus]
If you've been waitin’ for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I’ve been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

[Bridge]
Pull me oh so close
'Cause you never know
Just how long our lives will be

[Chorus]
If you've been waitin' for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

[Intro]
Better
Nothing, baby
Nothing feels better
I'm not really drunk, I never get that fucked up
I'm not, I'm so sober

[Verse 1]
Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
(Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are)
I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
(I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark)
No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
(No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored)
'Cause I live down the street
So we meet when you need and it's yours
All I hear is...

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I'll admit
Nothing feels better than this

[Verse 2]
You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around
(You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around)
You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?
(You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?)
'Cause I am
I got so high the other night, I swear to God, felt my feet lift the ground

Your back against the wall, this is all you've been talking about
In my ears

Yeah, started off right

What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

[Refrain]
Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)

I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 2]

I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late

Talk[Verse 1]
Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Verse 2]
Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Bridge]
'Cause I care, I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here around you
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care about you
Nowhere like I do
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
Don't care about you
Nowhere like I
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)[Intro]
Mmm, mmm
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
Don’t save me, I'm in no need of saving (Oh yeah)
And if you stay with me, I know you need patience (Yeah, yeah)
Blood and cologne on the fragrance (Mmm, yeah, yeah)
'Cause if ya deal with me, I know you know what pain is (Oh no)

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I’d hate for you to leave me attached

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
And I don't even like to think about it
On my own, but still so crowded
Walls come down and the guards come up
But there's nowhere to run, I feel surrounded
Hurt feels better when I'm by myself
No one really means it when they're wishing you well
I got no one to call, no one
And people only love you when they're needing your wealth
Damn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan
Everybody acting like they give a damn
Where is everybody when you need a hand?
I've been burning rubber on the Michelin
Flying in the rain like I'm Superman
I could say I love it, but that just depends

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I’d hate for you to leave me attached

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck

Won't you come through?
Water on me
We gon' walk right through
And I'm swimming like Nemo
No caller ID, no
You don't really like me, no
And I don't really like people
But you're better by default

[Verse]
No, red rocks so bright (So bright)
You can open your eyes
Hell all rise
Make you so blind (So blind)
With a thousand teeth like a Leviathan
Biting tightly on my wrist, it look like heaven
Weighing tightly on my neck until it breaks
If I lived too long, you'd kill me with a stake
No mistake, no mistake, no mistake
No mistake
The reflection never point the same way
ABBA on repeat, yeah
Diamonds like a dancing queen, so...

[Chorus]
Won't you come through?
Water on me
We gon' walk right through
And I'm swimming like Nemo
No caller ID, no
You don't really like me, no
And I don't really like people
But you're better by default
Won't you come through?
Water on me
We gon' walk right through
And I'm swimming like Nemo
No caller ID, no
You don't really like me, no
And I don't really like people
But you're better by default[Intro]

Don't check no mail, no phone
And I tell them I'm not home

Opposite the fame, it's the best thing in life

In the bed, on the couch, when you come it's amazing
We don't got a plan when the night goes now
When the lights go down

L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car

Remember when we first met?
You said, "Light my cigarette"
So I lied to my mum and dad
I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss

[Chorus]
Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

[Verse 2]
Remember when you taught me fate?
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day, nothin' on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hoping that things would change
But we went right back to your games

[Chorus]
Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

[Bridge]
And even if I run away
Give my heart a holiday
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more
I can't shake my hunger for
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Yeah, they always taste like you, you
Long nights, daydreams
With that sugar and smoke rings
Always taste like you

[Chorus]
Headlights on me

Racing to 60, I've been a fool

Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans

Lighters and candy, I've been a fool

Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you[Verse 1]
Hunnid thousand for the chain and now my drop (Drop, drop)
When I pull out the garage, I chop my top (Top, top)
Just like a fiend, when I start I cannot stop (Whoa)

Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold”

She said, "Love me" so I love her
She said, "Leave me" so I left
Then I went to California
And I ain't never comin' back

Run away, run away, run away

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go

And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles

Threw away the diamond ring
Don't you love it when it sting?

I know things don't feel the same
I've been drowning in my pain
I'll be sober
When it's over

[Verse]
Out my mind again, have I gone too far?
I done dropped the pen just to draw new scars
I got no regrets, didn't do no wrong
She ain't by my side, I'll be on my own

Searching for something, I'm searching for you
I feel so empty, what else can I do?
I get so faded, I'm crashing my coupe
I know you hate it when I'm loving you

Too much on my mind girl, I might die tonight
You be shining bright girl, tell another lie
I been feeling broken, keep it all inside
I been feeling broken, hard to say goodbye

I know things don't feel the same

Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

[Verse]
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out, and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle
Blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go on

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me

Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home[Intro]

Out of reach
Out of time
Maybe I'm too high
Out of mind
Out of line
Almost lost my sight
I don't know why I do this
I feel like I might lose you
Out of drugs, out of love (oh)
So let's compromise

The floor is raising, the sky is falling

Hate our haze
Different days

Never change, never take
There’s no compromise

So much drama in our face
A couple ways we can escape

[Chorus: Khalid]
I have a cabin in California
But The utilities are a couple months due
You have a house in Syracuse
Lets plan a road trip me and you

[Chorus: Tayla Parx]
My family doesnʼt like you anymore
Cause they know about our history
Lets run away and leave our town behind us Lets run away just you and me
Just wanna runaway
Just wanna runaway

[Verse 2: Tayla Parx]
You tell me
What's a storm without a little bit of lightning
What is love without a little bit of fighting
Canʼt believe that we're both unafraid to risk
Wait a minute
Are you really down for this?
Cause I'll be speeding if you tell me go
Tire screeching if you tell me no
Lets make freedom our favorite place
I'll fill the car up just incase

[Chorus: Tayla Parx & Khalid]
I have a cabin in California

Ayy, I waited for you all day

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I been away on the road for a little while
Today, I'm headin' home to make my baby smile
She hates it when I am over a thousand miles
Away, and I'm not there to pick up when she dials, yeah
She's always lookin back, and sayin' "There was a time
When you would be around every single night
Now, I'm not sayin' that I want another guy
But I need you here for the good times and the bad times
Yeah, the pullin' out my hair, gettin' mad times
Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own"

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

[Chorus: H.E.R. & Ed Sheeran]
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
I used to be around more, but I was strapped for cash
And that's not attractive, workin' my ass off
Tryna make a success outta myself I guess
I could have been more present, but I was in a mess
I remember bein' on tour, stayin' up on the phone
30 minute conversation, "Boy, when you comin' home?
I can't be buildin' a family life here on my own"
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why you takin' that tone?
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stackin' up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm poppin right now, but there will come a day when I won't

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran & H.E.R.]
There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home (Yeah)
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

[Chorus: H.E.R. & Ed Sheeran]
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I want all of your love, your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I just want your, I just want your time)

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran & H.E.R.]
You know you're my baby (You know you're my baby)

[Outro: H.E.R.]
And I love, and I love, and I love you
Yeah, I love, and I love, and I love you
And I love, and I love, and I love you
But I want your time, yeah
Want your time, time[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I feel it, can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I
I mean it, don't you turn off the light
Though I don't wanna leave you ever, no
She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a lil' romance," hey
You and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
Ooh-my-my-my

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Paulo Londra]
I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Prr)
But they ain't got nothing on you (Ah, ah)
And you ain't got nothing on you (Leones Con Flow)

[Verse 2: Paulo Londra]
Mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol, ah
Quiero comentarle que no sé qué pasó, ah
Desde que salimo' por la tarde lo' do'
A besarno' lo' do', hasta hacer el amor
Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación
Lo que hacemo' lo' do' no se puede igualar
Parecemo' ficción cuando entramo' en acción
Esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeh (Yo'; ¡wuf!)
Pero lo que mata e' que esta noche no' vemo' ya en mi casa (Ey; wuh)
Y sé lo que te gusta y te atrapa
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Paulo Londra]
I was rolling up something with you (¡Wuh!)
Kickin' back in a way that we do

But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you

[Verse 3: Dave]
Look, take the lead, follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard to get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Home girl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need, you and a sofa
I fly in a spaceship, I gotta land the Rover
Casa Cruz, Casa Blanca, Casanova
I'm a fashionista, she in Fashion Nova
And a mad persona when I had her over
The outfit, it cost bread, I got the matching loafers
Why? 'Cause that's suttin' to do
I got a million and two but they're nothin' on you, nah

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"

You want the lips and the curves, need the whips and the furs
And the diamonds I prefer, and my closet his and hers, ayy

Pull up to my spot in Lamborghini

My grandma tell me that I still look young
But my little cousin thinks I'm turning thirty-one
You know she only six-and-three-months
And you can't forget the months
Got me missing what it meant to grow up, yeah
I used to air up my tires, ride my bike to the park
Capri Sun me with friends, play ball 'til it's dark
You know them sleepovers, yeah, where ain't nobody sleep
'Cause if you did, you'd get the sharpie on your cheek
Man, I'm talkin' like:
Back then, it's like we always had plans
Mama used to make me listen to them clean versions
And we'd rock with no girls at the middle school dance
We making beats with our pencils, even way back then
I'm talking, yeah
Man, we grew up sharing plates
Now we all living in different states
My little homie Tanner had a pool
His parents were hella cool
We couldn't wait until the last day of school

[Chorus]
I said:
"Baby, I'm good, I'm good
I ain't ever been better"
This summer won't break my heart
I won't let her
And, now that I'm older, I wanna be younger
Now that I'm wiser, I wanna be dumber
Now that I know what I know, and I've seen what I saw
I wish that I could be a kid in the summer (summer, summer, yeah)

[Verse 2]
It's like we fourteen, now we all growned up
Big high schoolers now, we all cell-phoned-up
I used to text my old girl 'til my minutes were up
The first time we all drank, we done all throwned up
I'm talking, yeah
A get together at the crib
His parents were out of town, got a ride from my friends
We had some girls come over, ain't nobody sober
That's the first day I figured out what hungover meant (shooby dooby doop)
You know
Back then, it's like we always had plans (shooby dooby doop)
Used to wake up late for school, so I rocked sweatpants (shooby dooby doop)
The only thing that made it better: if I had class with my friends (shooby dooby doop)
Aw damn, we didn't study -- we crammed
You know I'm talking 'bout the cheap beer and vodka
Kisses at the locker
Prom night was tight, but the pics were hella awkward
Yeah: smoking weed, spraying cologne
Parents ask how I am when I'm home

[Chorus]
I said:
"Baby, I'm good, I'm good
I ain't ever been better" (I ain't ever been better)
This summer won't break my heart (break my heart)
I won't let her
And, now that I'm older, I wanna be younger
Now that I'm wiser, I wanna be dumber (I wanna be dumber)
Now that I know what I know, and I've seen what I saw
I wish that I could be a kid in the summer (summer, summer, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Now, I'm thirty-five with a wife and a kid
Coming home to see my parents, we ain't spoke in a grip
We hit the local spot, coffee shop -- table at the front
I ain't gotta peep the menu, I know what I want already, yeah
And, as we saying goodbye, I think I see my homie outside
My childhood friend, growing up since I was ten:
"I ain't seen you in forever, Cole, how you been?"
He said: "Brother, I'm good, I'm good, I'm great
I ain't ever been better"
Yeah
This summer won't break my heart, it won't break my heart
I won't let her
Yeah, yeah
And now that I'm older, I wanna be younger
Now that I'm wiser, I wanna be dumber
Now that I know what I know, and I've seen what I saw
I wish that we could be some kids in the summer

This summer won't break my heart (It won't break my heart)
I won't let her, yeah
And, now that I'm older, I wanna be younger
Now that I'm wiser, I wanna be dumber
Now that I know what I know, and I've seen what I saw

I'm in the back of the class and I got my hat real low
You know how that shit go

Man, I'm just tryna touch bases like I hit a homerun
So put your middle fingers down to your thumb
And just let it snap like that
Yeah, bring it back that's a wrap, hold up (hey)
And I got a pretty girl on the east side
We both scared to love so she only comes at midnight
The good times
OK, but this is for the day when everybody love theyself
And ain't nobody wanna trade, and ain't nobody wanna leave
'Cause everybody wanna stay
And we do something so great
That we just popped champagne because we did it
I lost my childhood friend
He caught a case in high school and I ain't even seen him since
But like a period I'm waiting for your sentence to end
Joey, this one for the day when you free again

[Chorus: Devvon Terrell]
What a beautiful day and let's keep it that way
Let's save all the trouble and throw it away
So we can have a world that's all together today
If you with me let me hear you say, let me hear you say
If you can dance in the rain (dance in the rain)
It ain't no thing (it ain't no thing)
Just grab an umbrella (just grab an umbrella)
And find a song to sing (and find a song to sing)

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
Let's find a song to sing
And a bunch of dope drinks for us all to bring
I began as a peasant and became a king
I started from the bottom wouldn't change a thing
So can we toast to it?
I ain't made it all the way but I'm close to it
So clueless, don't judge until you go through it
World colder than a Frieza watch me Goku it
I wanna make it last
More laughs, more money, and more Breaking Bad
She know I rap so she shaking ass
But don't try so hard, you just make me laugh
But can she sit still
Me and Kid Quill are sort of like a big deal
Tell them haters, they can get real
On the days like this we can just chill

[Chorus: Devvon Terrell]
What a beautiful day and let's keep it that way
Let's save all the trouble and throw it away
So we can have a world that's all together today
If you with me let me hear you say, let me hear you say
If you can dance in the rain (dance in the rain)
It ain't no thing (it ain't no thing)
Just grab an umbrella (just grab an umbrella)
And find a song to sing (and find a song to sing)
What a beautiful day and let's keep it that way
Let's save all the trouble and throw it away
So we can have a world that's all together today
If you with me let me hear you say, let me hear you say
If you can dance in the rain
It ain't no thing
Just grab an umbrella
And find a song to sing

That’s tight, my heart’s racing faster

Oh, thinkin ‘bout that night last June
Tell me, tell me

To try to learn something new but all I’ve really learned is that
I have got a one trick mind and I’ll be fine if I can have you

Okay, this song right here remind me of my ex
Say I be declinin' all her calls and I don't respond to none of her texts
I be like, "Girl, hush your mouth, you know I ain't got time for nothin' but sex"
She know I injured my right hand so when I get behind I use my left
She watched that "Walker Texas Ranger," say I remind her of Nas X
I'm talkin' "Old Town Road," all my hoes down low
They like girls and I like girls, three at a time, sometimes four
And if my backend not all hundreds and ain't on time, then I don't go
I be like...

Don't tell me you're falling
With your feet still on the ledge
I'm all out of breath
Baby, don't run me 'round and 'round
Don't kiss me, no, don't kiss me right now
On your lips, just leave it
If you don't mean it

Oh, yeah
You know you got me in the palm of your hand
But I love those hands
Oh, yeah
But you only let me hold you when he can't
Yeah, I don't understand

'Cause I'm all, I'm all in

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I'm single again (Single again)
Told her we'll be better off friends (Uh)
Baby, I should just focus on me (On me)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again (Single again)
Told 'em that we better off friends (Off friends)
Blaming you is just so easy (Woah)
But maybe the problem's me
I'm single again (Single again)
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Gon' be)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (On me)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me (On me)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Instead of blaming all my old girls when I leave (What?)
Instead of calling up these fake hoes that I don't need (What?)
Old relationships turn to new déjà vus
Got me feeling like, "I don't fuck with you"
Oh nah, nah, that's the old me
You fucking with the new me (Yeah)
Honestly, all the disrespect had damn near ruined me (Damn near)
All the trust gone, seems like all you say is, "Prove it to me" (Straight)
And you know I suck at lying, don't, don't do it to me (Don't)
Maybe 'cause my mom had never worked it out with my dad (Damn)
Maybe 'cause he had insecurities and she had 'em back (Uh-huh)
Maybe 'cause single parent love was all I ever had
Who knows? (Who knows?)

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, Big Sean]
I'm single again (Single again)
Told her we'll be better off friends (Off friends)
Maybe I should just focus on me (On me)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again (Single again)
Told 'em that we better off friends (Off friends)
Blaming you is just so easy (Uh-huh)
But maybe the problem's me (Straight up)
I'm single again (Single again)
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Yeah, yeah)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (On me)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me

Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time
Take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Even if I'm late, I'ma take my time

[Verse 2: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign]
What have you done for yourself?
What have you done for your mental health? (Yeah, yeah)
I even tried the drugs and they didn't help
Short term fix, that breaks everything else (Oh, oh)
And my bros keep throwing me these random girls in stallions
I need the best advice, went across the street to Khaled (Oh)
He said the major key is to be strong on your own
Lose your other half, you're never off balance (Oh)
Lookin' for the love in somebody else
That I probably should've gave to myself
Cycles I need to break in myself
If I'm alone, I'm second to no one else, so (Yeah)

[Chorus: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm single again (Oh)
Told her we'll be better off friends (Better off friends)
Maybe I should just focus on me (On me)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again
Told 'em that we better off friends (Oh, yeah)
Blaming you is just so easy (Oh)
But maybe the problem's me (Ooh)
I'm single again
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Way)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (Way)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me (Ooh)

Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah

[Verse 1: Lauv]
Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think that they make anything that strong, so I hold on
I, I, oh I, yeah

Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on
I, I, oh I
Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound

Can't unmiss you, but I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home

So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs (Someone take me home)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home ('Cause I can't be alone)
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs ('Cause I'm so tired)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home (Tired of love, tired of love)

I never thought that it would hit this hard
In the city, we sinning, we don’t ever want to come down
I never thought that it would hit this hard

[Verse 2]
Me and J take over and we way up
Now high above the city of angels
Smoke a boge in the sky, pass the fuego

Only came to the club 'cause they paid us
Take this shit and lemme see what you made of
No sleep, little mama, we gon' stay up
Vampires on a night in Las Vegas

Oooh, yeah
I ran through, yeah
I feel a change in the air tonight
I saw myself in a different light
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
I never thought that it would hit this hard
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
I never thought that it would hit this hard

[Chorus]
I just keep running and running and running around
I never thought that it would hit this hard
The feeling is different instead when you wake on the ground
I never thought that it would hit this hard
I don't know who I was in and I don't know anymore
I never thought that it would hit this hard
In the city, we sinning, we don’t ever want to come down
I never thought that it would hit this hard
I just keep running and running and running around
I never thought that it would hit this hard
The feeling is different instead when you wake on the ground
I never thought that it would hit this hard
I don't know who I was in and I don't know anymore
I never thought that it would hit this hard
In the city, we sinning, we don’t ever want to come down
I never thought that it would hit this hard[Intro: Swae Lee & Gucci Mane]
Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
(Ear Drummers)
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL!
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive 'em
But you said you didn't need 'em (Mike WiLL Made-It!)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser (oh yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (ah)
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly (slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinking (oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (remember)

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', "Everybody's famous!"
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly (slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' llello to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle[Intro: Swae Lee]
Yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone & Swae Lee]
I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night?
Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (My night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
My necklace has a natural glow
She dancin' in the strobe
Let's fuckin' spoil my night (Spoil my night)
Spent so much cash, I lost her
My cup was too toxic
I took the robe off (Yeah)
I couldn't get her off me
Dropped plenty money on her thighs
There's plenty room in my ride
I've never been like a small fry
She took me in, that's on my life

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Post Malone]
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (My night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night
I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night? (Spoil my night)
Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Yeah, when I walk up in a party, they all act like they know me
Then I spotted lil' mama through the wall of jabronis (Ooh)
Point her out so I can bag her if they just bring her to me (bring her to me)
I ain't even see the face, but she got beautiful boobies (Wow)
And she see those diamonds in my teeth (In my teeth)
I see her smilin' back at me (Back at me)
I think she rock with me like Jumanji (Jumanji)
It's about time, Postmate Plan B
Now she whippin' out her phone and I know (And I know)
Damn, how many videos you gon' post?
Everybody on the 'Gram gonna know
My girl at home now my line about to blow (Yeah)
I know what I'm doin' ain't right
But ain't no need to spoil my night, no need, no need

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Post Malone]
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (My night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night
I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night? (Spoil my night)
Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time (Yeah)

[Outro: Swae Lee]
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night, spoil my night[Chorus]
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down
'Cause this feels better to me
Than anybody reality
I'm floating in the air like I'm weightless
Flying on a cocaine spaceship
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down

[Verse 1]
I don't know what I took
All I know is that I'm hooked
24 hours got me seeing blue dragons
Molly and the Henny got me speaking different language
Thinking 'bout the world now my mind, no tragic
Thinking 'bout the world now my mind, no tragic

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down
'Cause this feels better to me
Than anybody reality
I'm floating in the air like I'm weightless
Flying on a cocaine spaceship
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down

[Verse 2]
I don't know where I am
My time's frozen and I can't comprehend
Can you stop? Quit fronting on me
I'ma stretch her back like a limousine
Everybody love me, tryna surf my wave
On designer drugs, can't feel my face

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down
'Cause this feels better to me
Than anybody reality
I'm floating in the air like I'm weightless
Flying on a cocaine spaceship
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down

[Outro]
Yeah, I don't think that I'll ever come down
Yeah, I don't think that I'll ever come down, yeah
