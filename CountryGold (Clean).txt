[Verse 1]
I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

[Verse 2]
I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

[Bridge]
Yeah, you think I'm down and out, hidin' out, hell-bent crazy
But that ain't me, baby

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
But I'm a long way from broke down
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
Ask any ol' barstool

[Outro]
I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide[Verse 1]
We say goodbye see you around
We turn our backs then turn back around
We break up we make up and we make love
We can’t seem to let go girl

[Chorus]
So I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over

[Verse 2]
I’m all alone, but you’re on my phone
Tellin' me you miss me and that you’re at home
Who knows what we are in the mornin'
All I know is I want you

[Chorus]
So I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over
Ooh, I’m comin' over

[Bridge]
Yeah we said that we’re done and I know that it’s late
But you already know, I’m on my way

[Chorus]
I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire that’s burnin'
I’m comin' over
Runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure
Save it for another time
Try not to think about you
But it ain’t workin'
Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer
I’m comin' over
I’m comin' over[Verse 1]
Sometimes you gotta drink about somebody
But that ain't goin' bring 'em back
Sometimes you gotta cry and miss somebody
Yea, we've all felt like that
If it's something that you gotta get over, but you just can't get over

[Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you're wishing you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closin’ time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind

You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you’re goin’ through
‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you try to fix somebody
Just to find out they’ll never change
So you go out and meet somebody
That makes you feel the way you thought you’d never feel again

[Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain
If you’re wishin’ you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closin’ time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind

You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you’re goin’ through
‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you
Yeah (Yeah)

[Bridge]
Oh, girl loses boy, the best remedy is
Girl meets boy, girl don’t make it harder than it has to be
Come and lay one on me
Hmm hmm
You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
Yeah I know what you’re goin’ through, I do

[Chorus]
So come on and kiss somebody
In the back of the cab or on the subway train
Come on and kiss somebody
On the midnight street in the summer rain
If you’re wishin’ you were with somebody
‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closing time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind

You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
I know just what you’re goin’ through
‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you
I wanna kiss somebody[Verse 1]
Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm

[Verse 2]
Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah
Mmm

[Bridge]
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace

[Chorus 2]
Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man
Mmm[Verse 1]
All the pretty girls said pick me up at eight
All the pretty girls said I'm going to L.A
All the pretty girls said I hate my hair
Talking to the mirror in their underwear

All the lost boys said I just got paid
All the lost boys said I wanna get laid
When the town goes blue and the lights blink red
All the lost boys do what all the pretty girls said

[Chorus]
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said

[Post-Chorus]
All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said

[Verse 2]
All the sheriffs said kid, you better slow down
All the preachers said it's the devil's playground
I wonder if they knew they were wasting their breath
All I ever heard was all the pretty girls said

[Chorus]
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said

[Post-Chorus]
All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said

[Bridge]
All the seventeens said I'm getting outta dodge
All the big dreams said I'm selling all I got
All the high rollers busy placing their bets
Me, I'm heading south cause all the pretty girls said

[Chorus]
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said

[Post-Chorus]
All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said

[Outro]
All the pretty girls said[Verse 1]
Why do you keep on staring?
That mirror, mirror, it ain't fair at all (Mmm, mm)
Dress sizes can't define
Don't let the world decide what's beautiful, no

[Pre-Chorus]
You won't make yourself a name if you follow the rules
History gets made when you're acting a fool
So don't hold it back and just run it
Show what you got and just own it
No, they can't tear you apart

[Chorus]
If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on

[Verse 2]
Don't follow anyone
March to the rhythm of a different drum (Mmm, mm)
Why do we analyze, break out, and criticize the crazy ones? Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You won't make yourself a name if you follow the rules
History gets made when you're acting a fool
So don't hold it back and just run it
Show what you got and just own it
No, they can't tear you apart, no

[Chorus]
If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on

[Bridge]
Put your hands up, show me that you're one of a kind
Put your hands up, let me hear your voice tonight
Oh

[Chorus]
If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on

Traveled on
Take the road less traveled on[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 1]
Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 2]
Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine[Verse 1]
This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic, don't it?
I'm right where I wanna be

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this

[Verse 2]
I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never
Had to even leave this room

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
Could be better than this

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this (heaven)
Could be better than this (heaven, heaven)

[Outro]
I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time[Verse 1]
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that "come get me" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Verse 2]
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV"
And she falls asleep

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Bridge]
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me[Intro]
I got it good, girl
'Cause I got myself a good girl
Yeah, you up and took my whole world
And made it so good, girl

[Verse 1]
You're an angel, you're a keeper
The kinda thing that you gotta lock down
I'm lovin' just livin'
Every minute since you came around
I was lost in the neon lights
'Til the day that you called me yours, yeah
And they say when you know you know
And I know one thing's for sure

[Chorus]
I got it good, girl
'Cause I got myself a good girl
Still can't believe I found you
Can't imagine life without you
I could take you home to mama
Take you to the church right down the street
Yeah, you up and took my whole world
And made it so good, girl
Aw, so good, baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
You know, sometimes, I dream
'Bout 55 years from now
Gonna still be you and me
Watchin' that sun goin' down
I'll still be stealin' your kisses (What else?)
I'll still be holdin' your hand (What else?)
I'll still look at you and I'll pinch myself
Good Lord, I'm a lucky man

[Chorus]
I got it good, girl
'Cause I got myself a good girl
Still can't believe I found you

Take you to the church right down the street
Yeah, you up and took my whole world
And made it so good, girl
Aw, so good, baby[Verse 1]
You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new

[Pre-Chorus]
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Verse 2]
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'

[Chorus]
And I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

You standin' there in that dress
Girl, it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do

After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

Oh, you know it, baby
Mmm[Verse 1]
I had a couple beers with one of my friends
​Told him just how our story ends
​Did all I could to try to make it work
​But you drug my heart through the Alabama dirt

[Verse 2]
​I've been at the house, climbin' them walls
​Checkin' that calendar, x'in days off
​Hit another bar, call another friend
​Throw a few down, tell the story again
​
[Chorus]
​Hey, hey, what can I say?
​I can just lie and say it's all okay
​Oh, oh, what can I do?
​Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
​But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
​No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
​
[Verse 3]
I'm finally gettin' out back into the world
​Life is good, I met me a girl
​She got a beautiful heart, eyes are blue
​I don't hardly ever think about you
​
[Chorus]
​Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh, oh, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to

​Sometimes I find peace of mind in a bottle of wine
​Sometimes I break down and cry

[Chorus]
​Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh, oh, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you

I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh, oh, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you

No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
​No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
It don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to[Verse 1]
Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
It was all roses, drippin' in diamonds
Sippin' on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Takin' his last name

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 2]
Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And havin' dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always gettin' way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil livin' in his eyes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 3]
Jenny slipped somethin' in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
Standin' there in a black dress singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
What if this goes south, what if I mess you up?
You say what if I break your heart in two, then what?

[Pre-Chorus: Kane Brown]
Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Verse 2: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if the sky falls (Sky falls)
Or the sun stops burnin'?
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'
Or I could kiss you (You should kiss me)
What if you liked it? (Bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
Awe yeah
C'mon

[Bridge: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
Damn

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Outro: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
Away (Away)
What if?[Verse 1]
Sunday morning
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

[Chorus 2]
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

[Bridge]
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours[Verse 1]
Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Verse 3]
Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey hey mama rock me
Mama rock me
Mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
You can rock me
Rock me[Intro]
Oh, babe

[Verse 1]
Never thought I would be like this
Wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss
Sippin' ninety proof, talkin' to the moon
Countin' down the hours till its two AM
Never thought I would be like this

[Chorus]
But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you

[Verse 2]
I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe
From the smell of your hair on the pillow case
Even if I tried without you by my side
I'd be dreamin with my eyes open
I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe

[Chorus]
But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you, no
I can't sleep without you, no, no

[Bridge]
I bet that DJ'S playin' your song
And your carryin' on
Baby I love the thought of that long as I know I'm the one you're comin home to

[Chorus]
But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you

[Outro]
Yeah no matter how late, baby I'll be stayin up
I can't sleep without you, no
Can't sleep without you
I can't sleep without you
Never thought I would be like this
Just wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss[Verse 1]
Something like a strong wind is coming over me
Has got a hold of me, yeah
Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be
Really I shouldn't be

[Pre-Chorus]
One more call
It’s one more “What'cha doing right now?”
It’s one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
One more here we go again

[Chorus]
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I’m not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you’re a goner
And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer

[Verse 2]
So calm and so cool, yeah I try to be
Like it don’t bother me
The last time was the last time
Until I’m all alone and picking up the phone

[Pre-Chorus]
It's one more call
It’s one more “What'cha doing right now?”
It’s one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
It's one more here we go again

[Chorus]
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I’m not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you’re a goner
And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer

[Chorus]
One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I’m not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you’re a goner
And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer

[Ending]
Stay a little longer
Wishing you could stay a little longer...[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
May we all get to grow up in a red, white, and blue little town
Get a won't-start, hand-me-down Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
'Cause you miss it too much

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
Hope you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up
And know that fifteen minutes of famous
Ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
We'll all be watching the TV the day that it comes

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line (Brian Kelley)]
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
'Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

[Verse 3: Both]
May we all do a little bit better than the first time
Learn a little something from the worst times
Get a little stronger from the hurt times
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one

[Outro]
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all (get to have a chance to ride the fast one)
May we all (walk away wiser when we crashed one)
May we all (keep hoping that the best one is the last one)
(yeah the last one)
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all[Verse 1]
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

[Verse 2]
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go

[Chorus]
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

[Verse 3]
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

[Verse 4]
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

[Chorus]
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen

[Bridge]
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh

Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night

Woah Springsteen

Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh[Verse 1]
They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 2]
So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

[Chorus 2]
When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 3]
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen

[Outro]
We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me[Verse 1]
Like a rainy Sunday mornin'
Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs

[Bridge]
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Verse 2]
You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah, I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Bridge]
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
You make it easy[Verse 1]
I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I know that you've been wondering
Mmm, so here goes nothing

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Verse 2]
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
One of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm, it's time you hear em

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Bridge]
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout ya
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah, you had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
In case you didn't know[Verse 1]
I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd, oh
But I can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh whoa, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
What are we waiting on?

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

[Bridge]
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, with the
River rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
We're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh[Verse 1]
She grew up around here, on that southwest side
Where the corn grows, up to the roadside
Went to high school here, got that Panther pride
She'll be cheering them on every Friday night

[Verse 2]
She couldn't hide her beauty with a baseball cap
Couldn't help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 21
But she never forgot, where she came from

[Chorus]
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

[Verse 3]
Her mamma's mamma was born right here
And her roots run deeper than that old town square
She's a good girl, but she's not uptight
She can rise and shine and she can hang all night

[Chorus]
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
She's got an old soul, she's the salt of the earth
When she gives her love, she knows what it's worth
There's a lot of pretty girls out there to me
But there's nothing like the one right across the street

[Chorus]
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

[Outro]
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
Ooh, ooh[Verse 1]
The way your fingers fit in mine
It's five plus five, not rocket science
This day in time, that's hard to find, it's true
The road we're on ain't a traffic jam
It's a Sunday drive on a piece of land
It's paradise as long as I'm with you

[Chorus]
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

[Verse 2]
We used to live on Instagram
Worry 'bout who all gives a damn
'Bout where we've been and where we ended up
Then I met you and you met me
And all the rest is history
An epiphany that all we need is us

[Chorus]
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin', love, make a lot out of a little
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style, yeah
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin', love, make a lot out of a little
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be[Verse 1]
I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush, ain’t slowin’ down
I got it real bad, want everything she has
That smile and the midnight laugh she’s givin’ you now

[Chorus]
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then, you’d want me just as much
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush

[Verse 2]
I don’t get no sleep, I don’t get no peace
Thinkin’ about her under your bed sheets
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s pullin’ you in
Lord knows I’ve tried, I can’t get her off my mind

[Chorus]
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you

I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush, it ain’t slowin’ down[Verse 1]
I'm a dirt road in the headlights
I'm a mama's boy, I'm a fist fight
Kinda county line, kinda cold beer
Little hat down, little John Deere
I kinda give a damn
I kinda don't care
You see that girl standing right there

[Chorus]
She loves a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
I'm turning it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me

[Verse 2]
She likes my T-shirt
She likes my old boots
Likes to slow dance to some old school
She'll take a full moon over those city nights
And I ain't scared to get all up in them bright lights
Yeah, I can smooth it out
I can stick it up
I guess that's why she can't get enough of

[Chorus]
A small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
I'm turning it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me
She loves a small town boy like me, yeah

Small town boy like me

Yeah, she loves a small town boy like me[Verse 1]
I ain't heard you laugh like that in a long time
I wonder if you stopped his world like you did mine just now
I see you sippin' white wine instead of whiskey
And does he want you to be just a little more city?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

[Chorus]
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (Baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (Crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up

[Verse 2]
He hasn't even looked your way since you walked in (Walked in)
But I can't help it that I can't take my eyes off of you
Your favorite song just came on and me and you were singing along (Singing along)
And he don't even know a single word

[Chorus]
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (Baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (Crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up
I'ma be the first to call baby

[Bridge]
Sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

[Chorus]
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (Baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (Crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
Oh, if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up[Verse 1]
I retired my red lipstick 'cause you said you didn't like it
I didn't wear my high heel shoes
'Cause I couldn't be taller than you
I didn't wanna lose my friends, but now it's hard to even find them
It's what you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
I thought I'd miss you

[Chorus]
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
I miss me more
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

[Verse 2]
I put on my old records that I hid in the back of the closet
And I turn them up to ten
And then I played them all again
I found my independence
Can't believe I ever lost it
What you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you

[Chorus]
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

[Bridge]
I thought I'd miss you
I thought it hurt me
And I'd wanna kiss you
I thought I'd miss you

[Chorus]
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
And I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more
(I miss me more)
(I miss me more)
(I miss me more)[Verse 1]
Since you turned the tables on me
I've been steady and learnin' lonely
Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
I've been havin' a record year

[Verse 2]
I bet you thought before you left
I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
I'm havin' a record year

[Chorus]
Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year

[Verse 3]
Your leavin' left me goin' crazy
I'm countin' on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go 'round and 'round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you
I rediscovered  Red Headed Stranger
Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back, I owe you a beer
For my record year

[Chorus]
Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year
Yeah, I'm havin' a record year[Verse 1]
She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', "no way she ain't got one"
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "come here, boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Verse 2]
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

[Chorus 2]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is"
She was like, "come here boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Bridge]
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

[Chorus 3]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "come here boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Outro]
Yeah play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody play it again, play it again, play it again[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
That lit up, ringing, buzzing good for nothing phone in your hands
With directions to the party that's just started with that cover band
That old school radio station, let's just drive until it's faded
Girl, let's lose it, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby, I swear

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Verse 2]
Let's start with them Luccheses
Baby, kick 'em to the floorboard
Them bobby pins holdin' your hair up
Girl, you don't need 'em no more
That dress hangin' off your shoulder as you move a little closer
Yeah, let's lose it tonight
Yeah girl

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doin' to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Bridge]
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby I swear
Um

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Outro]
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it[Verse 1]
Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Verse 2]
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

[Chorus]
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Bridge]
Yeah, you hit me Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane[Verse 1]
I love hearing that shower turn on
Bet there's nothing but a towel on you
You sing along with some Timberlake bumping
But he ain't got nothing on you
I don't wanna hear the coffee pouring
A goodbye kiss, then locking the door yeah
Sounds like leaving you, oh

[Chorus]
It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

[Verse 2]
Love the sound of the thunder rolling
Makes you move a little closer to me
Girl I bet that your neighbors hate us
'Cause we could laugh all night and never sleep
We can worry 'bout the world in the morning
Light up a candle, lock the door
Wanna stay right here with you, yes I do

[Chorus]
It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

[Bridge]
Turn your radio on, baby turn down the lights
I ain't going nowhere, I'm all yours tonight

[Chorus]
It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
I like the sound, and I love the sound of that
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

[Outro]
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Yes I do (I like the sound, I like the sound of that)[Verse 1]
We got a pontoon boat with a Yamaha
People dressed like they're in Panama
Small town, spring break
Every weekend 'round this place
And there's a bunch of boys tryna catch the eyes
Of all the pretty girls that are walking by
And those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah
Tan lines and gas station cheap sunglasses
They're coming here from all around

[Chorus]
To get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound

[Verse 2]
Bo got a ticket in a no-wake zone
But Katie's the one that should take it slow
'Cause she's dancin' on the dock and it's only 2 o'clock
Yeah, the fish ain't bitin' 'cause the party's on
The old men are thinkin' 'bout goin' home
But those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah

[Chorus]
We're gonna get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah
Woo!

[Bridge]
Yeah, we got the rope swing swingin' like a chandelier
Little bit of heaven on the water ride here
Don't need much, just a couple of beers and you and me
Gotta love this time of year
Getting southbound, southbound

[Chorus]
So let's get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Let's get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah[Verse 1]
I'm jealous of the blue jeans that you're wearing
And the way they're holding you so tight
I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on staring
So lock the door and turn out the night

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself
To myself

[Verse 2]
I'm jealous of the song that you've been singing
And the way it's rolling off your lips
It might be selfish but I'm thinking
I don't need nothing between you
Leaning for another kiss, yeah

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah

[Bridge]
Girl, I want you in the worst way
Yeah, I want you in the worst way (Mmmm)

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else (No one else, baby)
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall (Paint the wall)
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark (Hide away in the dark)
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah[Verse 1]
Met a man wearin' a T-shirt, says "Virginia is for lovers"
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He said "All you're really given is the sunshine and your name"
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

[Verse 2]
Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

[Bridge]
Find out when you die the keys to heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got to

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along[Verse 1]
Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick, sitting in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye-to-eye, and heart-to-heart
But maybe I’m just getting old
Used to work, but now it don’t

[Verse 2]
A long gone drive
You know the kind where you take a turn
And you don’t know why
But it clears your mind, a surefire cure
I need something stronger
That’ll last a little longer

[Chorus]
I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song

[Verse 3]
I wish I didn’t know so much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now that magic rush
Feels like a trick that isn’t working
But I haven’t lost all hope yet
Yeah, it’s hurting, but it ain’t dead

[Chorus]
I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song

[Bridge]
Give me a sign or a rhyme or a reason
Just something that I can believe in

[Chorus]
I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song[Verse 1]
Baby what's on your mind
When you see me pull up in your drive?
Do you wanna go downtown?
Maybe have a little high dollar wine?
Do you wanna go out to the country?
And maybe blow all our money
On some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs
See if we can lucky?
Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on
In your beautiful mind
Baby don't be shy
And tell me now

[Chorus]
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?

[Post-Chorus]
Stay up 'til the sun
Howl at the moon
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna

[Verse 2]
Karaoke in the neon light?
Go to Vegas, stay up all night?
See if we can find a cheap flight
Little 7, come 11, baby, roll those dice
Do I make you feel pretty?
Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me?
Do you wanna roll with me
To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city?
Do you wanna take in a broadway show
Or maybe just lay low?
I gotta know now

[Chorus]
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?

[Bridge]
Do I make you turn into somebody else?
Do you feel like you can finally be yourself?
Baby, tell me now

[Chorus]
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Out in the middle of nowhere now
We can take it back downtown
You know I don't care now
Just wanna take you there now
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?

[Outro]
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Oh baby
Tell me do I make you wanna?
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna
Let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Baby
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go flyin' down a two lane road?
Find a limb to hang your clothes on?
Oh, babe, tell me
Do I make you wanna?[Verse 1]
I'm just flesh and bone, heart and soul
And I've earned a couple scars
I've let once in a lifetime kind of things slide right out of my arms
I've struck out, I've been knocked down
More times than I can count
But that don't matter now

[Chorus]
'Cause when you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect oh, 'cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you, with everything I've got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot

[Verse 2]
You saw a spark inside of me that no one else could find
Your good morning eyes, they get me high
Girl, you're always on my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause when you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect oh, 'cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you, with everything I've got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot

[Bridge]
When I saw you for the first time, I knew I'd found amazing grace
It's like angels singin' every time I hear your name
When you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you, I'm not the man I was before you

[Chorus]
When you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm better than I was before you
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect oh, God knows I'm not
But I'll love you with everything I've got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot

[Outro]
I'm gonna give you, I'll give you my best shot
I'm gonna give, I'm gonna give you, yeah
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, yeah
Whoa, yeah[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
That Sunday morning choir calling, church doors open wide
That hallelujah, shoot right through ya, make you feel alive
That key under the mat, you know right where it's at
It's waiting with the porch light on
Don't bother calling, no need for knocking, just come on home
Come on home, my love is

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me

[Verse 2: Nick Carter]
Loud as shotgun, angels singing with the radio
Praying with you every mile down any dead end road
You can tell me every secret that you been keeping
I'll hold it, lock and key
Up with you all night, holding you all night, I never leave
You better believe my love is

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me
You better believe it, you better believe it

[Bridge: AJ McLean]
Every step you take, I'll be as sure as your shadow
Every move you make, you know I'll follow you wherever you go
Baby, you know my love is

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally (unconditionally)
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me

[Outro: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God your mama, and me[Verse 1]
I am insensitive, I have a tendency to
Pay more attention to the things that I need
Sometimes I drink to much, sometimes I test your trust
Sometimes I don't know why you're staying with me

[Chorus]
I'm hard to love, hard to love,  no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good

[Verse 2]
I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning, full of grace and full of Jesus
I wish that I could be more like you

[Chorus]
I'm hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
Love me good

[Bridge]
Girl you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted
I'm just a man, I'm just a man

[Chorus]
Hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Good

[Outro]
You love me good[Verse 1]
Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

[Chorus]
I’m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Verse 2]
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

[Chorus]
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Bridge]
Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice

[Chorus]
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away, away, away
Yeah I'm still one number away[Verse 1]
Daddy got sober, Mama got his best friend
I've cut down crying to every other weekend
Thanks for asking how I've been
I've gotten too good at hiding it
With an "I'm okay", "things are great"
But the truth is
Yeah, the truth is

[Chorus]
I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright
For the first time, in a long time, I'm doin' fine
I'm doin' fine

[Verse 2]
Daddy signed the papers the day I turned 19
And Mama drove north to find a new beginning
I blamed God, I blamed myself
Then I found my knees and prayed like hell
It's funny how a touch of grace gives you healing
Yeah, I'm healing

[Chorus]
I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright
For the first time, in a long time, I'm doin' fine
I'm doin' fine, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
All these old pains
And I wish they'd go away
But I guess you can't be free without a fight

[Chorus]
I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright
Oh, for the first time, in a long, long time, I'm doin' fine
I'm doin' fine
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Daddy got sober, Mama got his best friend
But I'm doin' fine
Yeah, yeah[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at

[Pre-Chorus 1: Florida Georgia Line]
Who knows where this road is supposed to lead?
We got nothing, but time
As long as you're right here next to me, everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be

So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha]
I don't mean to be so uptight
But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gon' lie
'Cause I'm tired of the fake love
Show me what you're made of
Boy, make me believe

[Pre-Chorus 2: Florida Georgia Line]
Whoa, hold up girl, don't you know you're beautiful?
And it's easy to see

So c'mon, ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes

Baby, if it's meant to be

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha, Florida Georgia Line, Both]
Maybe we do
Maybe we don't
Maybe we will
Maybe we won't

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha, Florida Georgia Line, Both]
But if it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be (Sing it, baby)
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be (C'mon)

Baby, if it's meant to be[Verse 1]
You're on the couch, blowing up my phone
You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soiree
If you're in the mood, sit tight right where you are, babe

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you

[Chorus]
We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down

[Post-Chorus]
If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

[Verse 3]
Throw a neon t-shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shaking the floor, rattling the roof
We'll go to town right there in your living room

[Chorus]
Let's have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down

[Post-Chorus]
If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

[Verse 1]
If I had a dollar every time that I swore you off
And a twenty every time that i picked up when you called
And a crisp new Benjamin for when you're here then gone again
And a dollar every time I was right about you after all

[Chorus]
Boy, I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky... Shit, I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da

[Verse 2]
If I had a dime every time that you crossed my mind
Well, I'd basically be sitting on a big ass pile of dimes
And all the times that you make my heart feel cheap
I might as well have won the lottery
All of this pain and me cursing your name
Would just turn into dollar signs

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky... Shit, I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da

[Bridge]
Told myself I wouldn't do this again
But how much you wanna bet I'mma do this again?

[Chorus]
Rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn

No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky... Shit, I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da

[Outro]
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was just hanging out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand
So I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye
Lke nothing I'd ever seen
Sunburned auburn air
The California dream
Yeah, she was shaking them hips
To some old motown song
I couldn't say anything
So I sang along

[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?

[Verse 2]
So I just hung around
This little west coast town
I dropped by every night
I stayed till closing time
My little mystery
That girl is killing me
So I put on a song
Just to sing along

[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinking about
All I think about, think about, think about

[Bridge]
So I'm right here right now
Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know

[Chorus]
You were a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, you're moving through my mind
I gotta know your name and I gotta see you again
And if you're listening, listening, listening
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Girl, I'm hanging around this little town
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?[Verse 1]
I've been thinking 'bout you all day, baby
Waiting on that sun to go down
Whatcha say I pick you up after work
Slide over, we slip out to the outskirts of town

[Verse 2]
I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
It’s supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like I’m going to have to hold you tight, yeah

[Chorus]
About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I hope it’s gonna be a long one
And if we’re lucky, it’s moving slow
I wouldn’t mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside
Let’s go

[Chorus]
About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train
Let’s go listen to the night train

About a mile off Old Mill Road
That spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train
Let’s go listen to the night train[Verse 1]
The scent that you left on my pillow
The sound of your heartbeat with mine
The look in your eyes like a window
The taste of your kiss soaked in wine

[Chorus]
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing

[Verse 2]
Guess you forgot what you told me
Because you left my heart on the floor
Baby, your ghost still haunts me
But I don't want to sleep with him no more

[Chorus]
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing

[Bridge]
They say time is the only healer
God, I hope that isn't right
Cause right now I'd die to not remember

[Chorus]
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
I'm haunted by the memories of
Every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Every little thing[Verse 1]
Turn me on turn me off then you turn me back on by the weekend
And you won’t say the words that I want but you flirt when you’re drinkin’
I see those bubbles pop up like you’re texting then they disappear
Lets cut through the shit then let’s get to what we’re doing here

[Chorus]
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama
Put my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama
Your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf
I'm asking you baby 'cause i’m tired of asking myself

[Chorus]
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing, are we dancing in the kitchen, baby tell me what it is or what it isn't
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand

[Outro]
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number I should wash right off my hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand[Verse 1]
It was the 14th of October
Had that t-shirt off your shoulder
I was drunk, said I was sober
And you said yeah right
We were talkin’ for a minute
Then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game

[Chorus 1]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Verse 2]
We were dancin’, we were buzzin’
Takin’ shots like it was nothin’
Did the runnin’ man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you
You probably didn’t think that it was true

[Chorus 2]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Bridge]
Oh, that night was just like you, baby
I can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin’
And it feels just like it was last weekend
That we jumped in
Right off the deep end

[Chorus 2]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Outro]
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable[Verse 1]
Man, this shit's unflatterin', all up in my head again
I don't feel myself right now, maybe I should just lay down
If vanity's my vitamin, well, I don't feel the difference
I don't like myself right now, gotta find a way out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What you feel is natural
But I don't wanna feel this anymore
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor
What you waitin' for?

[Chorus 1]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl

[Verse 2]
Draw your comparisons, tryin' to find who's lesser than
I don't wanna wear your crown, there's enough to go around

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What you feel is natural (Natural)
You don't gotta put up with this anymore (Anymore)
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor (Oh)
Tell me what you waitin' for?

[Chorus 1]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl

[Bridge]
Girl, don't hang your head low
Don't lose your halo, don't lose your halo
Girl, don't hang your head low
Don't lose your halo, oh

[Chorus 2]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl, won't you stop your cryin'? (Won't you stop your cryin'?)
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay (Everything's gonna be okay)
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low

[Outro]
Everyone's gonna okay, baby
Mm mm mm, mm mm mm
Hoo hoo hoo, hoo[Verse 1]
Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Verse 2]
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Bridge]
We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Outro]
I'ma take it slow
Just as fast as I can (Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed)
Got braids in her hair (I know every curve like the back of my hand)[Intro]

Rays of gold are shining on ya

[Verse 1]
Wheels rolling on an old Toyota
Twist top on a Sunkist soda
Your brown hair in the west coast wind
If heaven is anywhere
90’s hits at the top of our lungs
Shuffle landed on "Still the One"
Missing turns 'cause that's our song
If heaven is anywhere

[Chorus]
It's in a blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here
Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya

[Verse 2]
Red sun melting to the blacktop
Dollar shades from a nowhere truck stop
Your kiss and that coastline
If heaven is anywhere
Pull it over to the shoulder
To take it in
And pull you closer
Loving you longer than I ever did
Going places we never been
'Cause heaven's in

[Chorus]
A blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here

[Bridge]
Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya
If heaven is anywhere

[Chorus]
It's in a blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here
Blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
Rays of gold are shining on ya
(I'm always right here, always right here oh-oh, ooh)
Blue Tacoma, California (Oh)
Rays of gold are shining on ya
If heaven is anywhere[Verse 1]
8 o’clock on Friday night I’m still at home
All my girls just keep on blowin' up my phone
Sayin', "Come on, he ain’t worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name"
Now there’s only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

[Chorus]
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

[Verse 2]
Tonight I’ll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I’ll let him down easy
'Cause tonight it’s all about dancin' with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

[Chorus]
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

[Bridge]
I’m feelin' that buzz
I’m ready to rock
Ain’t no way I’m gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I’m comin' in hot
Hey bartender
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Hey Bartender
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender
Hey bartender[Verse 1]
I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor
Act like we never met before for fun

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one I want
You're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king
Ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you

[Verse 2]
The way you sparkle like a diamond ring
Maybe one day we can make it a thing
Test time and grow old together
Rock in our chairs and talk about the weather, yeah
So, bring it on in for that angel kiss
Put that feel good on my lips, cause

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one I want
You're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king
Ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm here to pick you up
And I hope I don't let you down, no

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one I want
You're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king
Ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one I want
You're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king
Ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you

[Outro]
I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor[Verse 1]
Would've thought you wrote down every word
Goodbye spelled out like it had been rehearsed
There ain't no point in trying to change your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems like
You've got it all figured out
You're alright
With the way this is going down

[Chorus]
Don't tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

[Verse 2]
By the way you're talking you would think
You never had any real feelings for me
And if you think I can look across the bar

[Pre-Chorus]
And see you
In someone else's arms
And I need you
Oh who do you think you are?

[Chorus]
Trying to tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

[Bridge]
You always told me
You'd never leave me
You said I was your one and only
So what makes you think I wanna hear you say
We can still be friends
No, I don't wanna be friends
Stop telling me, stop telling me, woah

[Chorus]
That we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
You really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you[Verse 1]
Quarter in a payphone
Drying laundry on the line
Watching Sun Tea in the window
Pocket watch tellin time
Seems like only yesterday I'd get a blank cassette
Record the country countdown cause I couldn't buy it yet
If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be
I learned to drive that 55 just like a queen, three on a tree

[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

[Verse 2]
If you had something to say
You'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you'd put a stamp on it
And they'd get it three days later
Boys would call the girls
And girls would turn them down
Staying married was the only way to work your problems out

[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

[Post-Chorus]
Automatic

[Bridge]
Let's pull the windows down
Windows with the cranks
Come on let's take a picture
The kind you gotta shake

[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic
